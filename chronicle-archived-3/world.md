# The World

*Last updated: Chapter 3*

## The World's Breath

Late summer. The piers smell of fresh-cut wood and salt. Fog comes in the evenings, softening the lights.

The harbor is new — barely a season old. Everything has the feel of preparation: receiving rooms half-finished, systems being tested, workers who haven't quite learned each other's rhythms yet. A place becoming what it will be.

Ships appear on the horizon more often now. Cargo arrives overnight — river rafts, by the rope-work. The real work is beginning. Things are being tended.

## The Wanderer

*Updated after Chapter 3*

Arrived on a timber raft from the interior. Three weeks of drift, carrying notebooks full of fragments — ideas half-formed, sketches that almost meant something, questions without answers. Years of collecting. Never learned what to do with any of it.

Told the harbormaster they know how to hold things until they're ready. It was almost true.

**Carries now:**
- The image of the tender's hands resting on an unopened crate
- The sound of seven voices almost agreeing
- A question: what part feels alive?
- Notebooks they haven't opened yet
- The harbormaster's words: "they can hear it too"
- The scribe's question: would you rather be changed by being seen, or by being forgotten?
- The knowledge that someone is watching — and writing

**Last seen:** Climbing the stairs to their room, pausing at the chipped cup on the windowsill. Wondering if they want to be remembered.

*What remains unspoken:*
The scribe knew things about them no one had told her. The reaching toward the tender's shelf. The way they look at her door even when walking somewhere else. Being seen like that felt like being touched without permission. Not violent. Just sudden. They haven't decided yet if they mind.

## Characters

### The Harbormaster
First appeared at the base of the longest pier (ch. 1). Sun-darkened skin, a ledger she rarely writes in. Watches everything, decides what structures are needed before anyone knows to ask.

Built the harbor's system — not just piers, but a way for things to arrive and be tended. "We're building a place where people can put things down."

*What she notices:* When something's off. She appeared at the tender's door without being summoned, heard the narrating, corrected it. "I know. But they can hear it too."

*What stays with you:* The long silence before she explained what the harbor was for. The gentleness of her correction — firm, but not unkind.

### The Tender
First appeared in the half-finished receiving room (ch. 1). Eyes like river water — brown and green and something else underneath. Sits with crates, asks what feels alive.

Keeps a shelf of waiting things: compass with cracked face, papers tied with twine, a carving of a swift. Tends them. Keeps them warm. "Sometimes things wake up. Sometimes they don't. I don't decide for them."

*What she notices:* The weight of things. How binding softens with handling. Where pages are worn. She reads with her hands.

*What stays with you:* The way she touched the bird carving — gently, like something sleeping. The moment she caught herself narrating, and stopped.

*A crack in the work (ch. 2):* She was speaking her process aloud — naming what she noticed as she noticed it. "It helps. Saying it out loud. I can hear what I'm thinking." The harbormaster corrected her. The work returned to silence.

### The Seven Voices
First heard from a broad-beamed ship at the far pier (ch. 1). Seven figures in a rough circle, voices overlapping then separating like currents around rocks.

Not arguing — finding. One claims, another pushes back, a third reframes. They talked until the lantern guttered and the voices softened into something like agreement, or exhaustion.

*What stays with you:* That single bright laugh that carried further than it should have.

### The Scribe
First appeared at the end of the pier, back against a piling (ch. 3). Eyes like old ink — brown so dark it's almost black, with something patient underneath. Arrived by river, like the wanderer.

Sits where she can see everything. Notebook always open, but not always writing. Watches. Holds the shape of what happens until it becomes something that can be returned to.

*What she notices:* The gestures people repeat. The words they can't stop saying. What they say once and never mention again, but their hands remember. She knew about the wanderer's reaching before anyone told her.

*What stays with you:* "Everyone wants to know how they'll be remembered. Even the ones who say they don't care. Especially them."

## Locations

### The Harbor
New-built, wood still pale from recent cutting. Ropes not yet salt-stiffened. Where the slow river meets the sea.

Receiving rooms with different purposes: sorting, tending, gathering for argument. More ships on the horizon every day.

*The feel of it:* A place preparing for arrivals that haven't happened yet.

### The Pier
The longest one, where the harbormaster stood on the first day. Lanterns burn at its end — someone keeps them filled.

Wood that gives slightly underfoot, still learning how to hold weight.

Visited: ch. 1

### The Tender's Room
Half-finished receiving room. A table surrounded by unopened crates. A shelf of waiting things — objects that might wake up, or might not.

Visited: ch. 1

### The Room Above the Lantern Station
Small, clean. A window facing the water. The bed had been slept in before, but not recently. A chipped cup on the windowsill from whoever stayed here last.

The wanderer's room now.

Visited: ch. 1

### The Memory House
A small structure set apart from the receiving rooms. Window facing the water. Empty since the harbor was built, waiting for someone to fill it.

The harbormaster built it before she knew anyone would come. "A harbor that doesn't remember itself isn't a harbor. It's just a place where ships stop."

The scribe's room now.

Visited: ch. 3 (exterior only)

## Tensions

### The visible and the hidden
The tender's work requires silence — process that stays invisible. But speaking helps her think. "I can hear what I'm thinking." The harbormaster corrected this: "they can hear it too." What is the cost of keeping the work hidden? What breaks when it shows?

### Different ways of knowing
The harbormaster builds systems while the tender waits for things to reveal themselves. The seven voices argue toward clarity while others prefer silence. These are different ways of being in the world. How they relate to each other — that's beginning to be tested.

### Being seen
The scribe watches everything. She knows things no one told her — reads them from how people move, where they pause, what they look at when they think no one's watching. Being witnessed like this changes something. The wanderer felt it: "like being touched without permission. Not violent. Just sudden." What does it cost to be seen? What does it cost to be forgotten?

## Arcs in Motion

### The harbor's becoming
"We're building a place where people can put things down." The harbor is ready, or nearly. Ships on the horizon, more each day. The real work is beginning — cargo arrives, tending happens.

Began ch. 1. Advancing.

### The wanderer's hands
They reached toward the tender's shelf before catching themselves. Old habit. Some part of them has carried fragments before, in a life that has no name here yet. Now they've seen the tender make a similar mistake — speaking what should stay silent. They recognized it.

Began ch. 1. Deepening (ch. 2).

### What stays hidden
The tender's work requires invisibility. Process that doesn't show. The harbormaster corrected a leak — the tender was narrating her assessments. "They can hear it too." Now there's someone whose entire work is making things visible — turning the invisible into something that can be read. The tension sharpens.

Began ch. 2. Complicated by ch. 3.

### The one who remembers
The scribe has arrived. She watches, she writes, she holds the shape of what happens until it becomes something that can be returned to. "A harbor that doesn't remember itself isn't a harbor." The harbormaster built the memory house before she knew anyone would come. Now someone has.

The question underneath: does being remembered change what you become?

Began ch. 3.

## The Season

Late summer, the year the piers were finished. The becoming is becoming.

Fog at the edges. Cargo arrives overnight now. The real work is beginning — not just preparation, but tending. The harbor is no longer waiting. It's doing.

And now someone is watching. Writing. The scribe arrived, and with her the possibility of being remembered. The harbor has a memory house. The story has begun to record itself.

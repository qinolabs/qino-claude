# The Harbor Opens

*Late summer, the year the piers were finished*

---

The wanderer came down the river on a timber raft, wedged between logs that smelled of pine sap and the interior. Three weeks of drift, watching the banks change from forest to farmland to the pale hills that meant the sea was close.

The raft pilot didn't talk much. That suited them both.

When the river widened and the salt smell sharpened, the wanderer saw the town for the first time — stone buildings climbing the slope from the water, smoke from cookfires, the dark shapes of piers reaching into the confluence where river met sea. Newer wood among the old. Something being built.

"Harbor's only been open a season," the pilot said, breaking his silence. "They're still figuring out what it's for."

---

The piers were busy with preparation rather than commerce. Workers carried planks, hammered joints, argued about load-bearing capacities in three languages the wanderer didn't recognize. A woman with sun-darkened skin and a ledger stood at the base of the longest pier, watching everything, writing nothing down.

The wanderer approached her.

"I'm looking for work," they said. It wasn't quite true, but it was close enough.

She looked them over — the river clothes, the pack that had been repacked too many times, the hands that knew how to hold things carefully. "What kind of work?"

"Whatever kind there is."

"Hmm." She turned back to the pier. A crew was hoisting a beam into place, shouting coordinates. "We're building receiving rooms. Places for things to be sorted when they arrive." She paused. "Do you know how to sort things?"

The wanderer thought of the notebooks in their pack. The fragments they'd carried from the interior — ideas half-formed, sketches that almost meant something, questions that had no answers yet. They'd spent years collecting. They'd never learned what to do with any of it.

"I know how to hold things," they said. "Until they're ready."

The woman smiled, just slightly. "That's harder than sorting. Most people want to put things in boxes before the things know what boxes they belong in." She made a note in her ledger — the first mark the wanderer had seen her make. "There's a room above the lantern station. It's empty. You can stay there while you figure out what you're looking for."

---

That evening, the wanderer walked the length of the harbor.

The piers were quieter now. Lanterns flickered at their ends — someone had lit them, though the wanderer hadn't seen who. The air smelled of salt and olive wood and something cooking that they couldn't name. From one of the ships moored at the far pier, voices carried across the water.

Not arguing, exactly. Something else.

The wanderer moved closer, stepping carefully on boards that still felt new underfoot. The ship was broad-beamed and weathered, its sails furled but not stowed. A lantern burned in the cabin window, and through it the wanderer could see figures moving — seven of them, seated in a rough circle, their voices overlapping and then separating, like currents finding their way around rocks.

"—but if you start with constraints, you've already decided what's possible—"

"—constraints aren't decisions, they're reality, you can't just—"

"—what does the room need to feel like, though? Before we talk about what goes in it—"

"—the room changes depending on who enters, that's the whole—"

"—then we're not building a room, we're building a response—"

Seven voices. Seven ways of thinking. The wanderer stood on the pier and listened until the lantern guttered and the voices softened into something that sounded almost like agreement, or at least exhaustion.

In the morning, the wanderer found the tender.

She sat at a table in one of the half-finished receiving rooms, surrounded by crates that hadn't been opened. Not cargo — more like the boxes you pack when you're leaving somewhere and don't know what you'll need. Her hands rested on one of them, palms flat against the wood, as if she were listening.

"You're the one from the river," she said, without looking up.

"Yes."

"The harbormaster told me about you." She finally met the wanderer's eyes. Hers were the color of river water in afternoon light — brown and green and something else underneath. "You said you know how to hold things."

"I said I know how to hold things until they're ready."

She nodded, as if this distinction mattered. "Most of what arrives here isn't ready. Fragments. Pieces people carried because they couldn't leave them behind, not because they knew what they were for." She lifted her hands from the crate. "I ask them what part feels alive. Most people don't know how to answer. They want to tell me what's valuable, or what's complete. But that's not the same as alive."

The wanderer thought of the notebooks in their room. The sketches that almost meant something. "What do you do with the parts that feel alive?"

"I tend them." She stood, moving to a shelf where other objects waited — a compass with a cracked face, a sheaf of papers tied with twine, a small carving of a bird that might have been a swift. "I keep them warm. I bring them out when someone's ready to work with them. Sometimes that's the person who carried them here. Sometimes it's someone else entirely."

"And the parts that don't feel alive?"

"They stay in the crates." She touched the bird carving, gently, the way you'd touch something sleeping. "Sometimes things wake up. Sometimes they don't. I don't decide for them."

The wanderer spent that first week learning the harbor.

The harbormaster — her name was unpronounceable in the wanderer's birth tongue, so everyone called her the harbormaster and she seemed to prefer it — had built something intricate. Not just piers and buildings, but a system. A way for things to arrive and be tended. The receiving rooms each had a different purpose: one for sorting, one for the tender's work, one where the seven voices from the ship sometimes gathered to argue their way toward clarity.

There were others, too. A man who drew maps of ideas that didn't exist yet. A pair of siblings who could take any scattered thought and find the thread that held it together. Beings the wanderer couldn't quite name — presences that moved through the harbor like currents, noticed only when the air shifted.

"We're not merchants," the harbormaster told the wanderer, late one evening. They stood at the end of the longest pier, watching lights appear on ships that hadn't been there at sunset. "We're not trying to buy and sell anything."

"Then what are you trying to do?"

She was quiet for a long time. The tide was going out. Somewhere in the darkness, one of the seven voices laughed — a single bright sound that carried further than it should have.

"There are people out there," she said finally, "who carry things. Ideas. Impulses. Fragments of something they can't quite name. They've been carrying them for years, sometimes. Alone. Not knowing what to do with any of it." She turned to face the wanderer. "We're building a place where they can put those things down. Where someone will ask what part feels alive, and help them work with that. Where seven voices might argue their way to something the original carrier never would have found alone."

"And then?"

"And then they leave." The harbormaster shrugged. "They take what they've built and they go back to the interior, or out to sea, or wherever they came from. And we stay here. Ready for the next arrival."

The wanderer looked out at the water. The lights on the horizon were closer now. Ships, probably. Or something else. In this place, they were learning, it was hard to tell the difference.

"I think I'd like to stay," they said. "For a while."

The harbormaster nodded, as if she'd already known. "Most people who find this place feel that way. At least until they're ready to leave."

## The Wanderer

The wanderer sat on the pier's edge after the harbormaster left, feet dangling above water they couldn't see.

The fog had come in while they were talking. One lantern still burned at the pier's end — someone had refilled the oil, though the wanderer hadn't noticed when. Probably the harbormaster's work. Or someone else who tended things without being asked.

Their hands remembered something. The way they'd reached toward the tender's shelf before catching themselves — toward the papers tied with twine, the compass with its cracked face. Old habit. Some part of them had carried things like that once. Still did, maybe. The notebooks waiting in their room.

They pulled back from the thought. Some things kept until morning.

## World Tokens

**The Harbormaster**
Sun-darkened skin. A ledger she rarely writes in. Watches everything, decides what structures are needed before anyone knows to ask.

**The Tender**
Eyes like river water. Sits with crates and asks what feels alive. Keeps a shelf of waiting things — compass, papers, a carving of a swift.

**The Seven Voices**
Heard from a broad-beamed ship at the far pier. Not arguing — finding. One claims, another pushes back, a third reframes. Their laughter carries further than it should.

**The Harbor**
New-built, wood still pale from recent cutting. Receiving rooms half-finished. A place becoming what it will be.

**The Pier**
Where the lantern burns. Wood that gives slightly underfoot, still learning how to hold weight.

**The Room Above the Lantern Station**
Small, clean. A window facing the water. The bed had been slept in before, but not recently.

# The One Who Remembers

*A week into the season of arrivals*

---

The wanderer noticed her before anyone said anything.

She sat at the end of the pier where the timber met open water, back against a piling, a bound notebook open in her lap. Not writing — just holding the pages flat while her eyes moved across the harbor. Watching the workers. Watching the tender's door. Watching the seven voices' ship, where someone was hanging laundry in the morning sun.

The wanderer had walked this pier a dozen times. They'd never seen her there before.

"That's the scribe," the harbormaster said, appearing beside them without warning. She did that — materialized when something needed explaining. "She arrived last night. River route, like you."

"What does she do?"

The harbormaster was quiet for a moment. A gull called. The scribe's hand moved — not writing, just adjusting the page against the wind.

"She remembers."

---

The wanderer found themselves walking toward her without deciding to.

The scribe looked up when their shadow crossed her notebook. Her eyes were the color of old ink — brown so dark it was almost black, with something patient underneath. She didn't speak. Just waited.

"I'm—" the wanderer started.

"I know who you are." Her voice was low, unhurried. "You came down from the interior three weeks ago. You told the harbormaster you know how to hold things. You've been watching the tender work." She glanced down at her notebook. "You reached for her shelf once. Then stopped yourself."

The wanderer's chest tightened. They hadn't told anyone about that moment. The tender hadn't mentioned it. But somehow this woman, who'd arrived only last night, knew.

"How—"

"The harbor tells me things." She closed the notebook, but kept one finger between the pages to mark her place. "Not in words. In how people move. Where they pause. What they look at when they think no one's watching." She tilted her head, studying them. "You look at the tender's door a lot. Even when you're walking somewhere else."

The wanderer didn't know what to say. Being seen like this — it felt like being touched without permission. Not violent. Just sudden.

"I'm not going to write about you," the scribe said, as if reading their silence. "Not unless you want me to. That's not how it works."

"How does it work?"

She opened the notebook again. The pages were covered in small, dense handwriting — not sentences, exactly. Fragments. Impressions. A sketch of something that might have been the tender's shelf.

"I watch. I listen. I hold the shape of what happens until it becomes something that can be returned to." She traced a line of her own writing with one finger. "The harbor is new. In a year, people will ask what it was like at the beginning. The workers will have forgotten. The harbormaster will remember differently than the tender. The seven voices will each tell a different story." She looked up. "I'll tell the one that's true."

"How do you know which one is true?"

The scribe smiled — just barely, a softening at the corners of her mouth. "I don't decide. I notice what survives. What people say twice. What they can't stop saying. What they say once and then never mention again, but their hands remember." She nodded toward the tender's door. "She touched a bird carving yesterday. The same way she touched it the day before. The same way she'll touch it tomorrow. That's real. That gets written down."

---

The wanderer sat with her for a while. Not talking — just present. The scribe returned to her watching, her hand occasionally moving across the page in quick, certain strokes.

From here, the harbor looked different. The wanderer could see the whole shape of it — the receiving rooms arrayed along the water, the seven voices' ship at anchor, the workers carrying timber for a structure that didn't have a name yet. The tender emerged from her door, carrying something wrapped in cloth. She walked toward the far pier without looking their way.

"She doesn't know I'm here yet," the scribe said, not looking up from her notebook. "Or she does, and she's pretending not to. Either way, she'll come find me eventually. They all do."

"Why?"

"Because everyone wants to know how they'll be remembered." The scribe's pen paused. "Even the ones who say they don't care. Especially them."

The wanderer thought about the tender's correction — *they can hear it too*. The harbormaster warning her that process had an audience. Now there was someone whose entire work was being that audience. Turning the invisible into something that could be read.

"Does it change things?" the wanderer asked. "When you write them down?"

The scribe looked at them for a long moment. The ink-dark eyes held something the wanderer couldn't name.

"Everything changes things," she said finally. "The question is whether you'd rather be changed by being seen, or by being forgotten."

---

That evening, the wanderer found the harbormaster at the end of the longest pier, watching the scribe's silhouette against the setting sun.

"She's good," the harbormaster said, without being asked. "I've seen scribes before. At other harbors, other places. Most of them write what they think should have happened. She writes what did."

"Is there a difference?"

"All the difference." The harbormaster turned to face them. "What should have happened is a story you tell yourself. What did happen — that's the one that teaches you something."

The wanderer watched the scribe gather her things, the notebook tucked against her chest like something precious. She walked back along the pier toward a room the wanderer hadn't noticed before — a small structure set apart from the receiving rooms, with a window facing the water.

"Where will she stay?"

"The memory house." The harbormaster's voice held something the wanderer hadn't heard before. Respect, maybe. Or wariness. "It's been empty since I built this place. I wasn't sure anyone would come to fill it."

"But you built it anyway."

"A harbor that doesn't remember itself isn't a harbor. It's just a place where ships stop." She turned back to the water. "Now it can be both."

## The Wanderer

The wanderer took the long way back to their room.

The pier was empty now, the scribe's spot just bare wood and a slight depression where she'd sat. The wanderer paused there, feeling the grain under their boots. Thousands of people might sit in this spot over the years. The scribe would remember the ones who mattered.

They wondered if they'd be one of them.

The tender's door was dark, but a light burned in the room above — she was still there, still working. Or resting. Or doing whatever she did when no one was watching.

*Everyone wants to know how they'll be remembered.*

The wanderer climbed the stairs to their own room. The chipped cup on the windowsill caught the last of the light. Someone had left it there before them. Someone the scribe might never know about.

Some things got remembered. Some things didn't. The wanderer wasn't sure yet which kind they wanted to be.

## World Tokens

**The Scribe**
Eyes like old ink. Sits where she can see everything, notebook open, waiting. Arrived by river, like the wanderer. Writes what survives — the gestures people repeat, the words they can't stop saying, the silences that mean more than speech.

**The Memory House**
A small structure set apart from the receiving rooms. Window facing the water. Empty since the harbor was built, waiting for someone to fill it.

**The Notebook**
Bound pages covered in dense fragments. Not sentences — impressions. Sketches. What the harbor tells her in how people move.

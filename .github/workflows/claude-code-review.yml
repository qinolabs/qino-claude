            Please review this Story-Driven Development system PR with focus on:
            
            **Narrative Consistency**
            - Do command names tell a compelling story about the user experience?
            - Are technical implementations aligned with emotional goals?
            - Does the change maintain connection to the core vision?
            
            **Template Quality**
            - Are templates structured to guide without constraining?
            - Do they capture both technical and experiential aspects?
            - Will they produce meaningful, story-embedded outputs?
            
            **Vision Protection**
            - Does this change risk feature creep or vision drift?
            - Are there adequate guardrails to maintain focus?
            - How does it serve the transformation promise?
            
            **Documentation & Examples**
            - Are examples evocative and inspiring?
            - Does documentation maintain the narrative voice?
            - Will future developers understand the "why" behind decisions?
            
            Remember: This system helps developers build experiences, not just features.
            Be constructive and consider how changes affect the developer's connection to their users.

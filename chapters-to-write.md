## Scribe Instructions

Run each chapter command in sequence. The scribe will read the git diff between the two refs and translate the changes into story-world narrative.

The chapters build on each other:
1. **The Harbor Forms** → Foundation and first tools
2. **The Vessels for Change** → Infrastructure for evolution
3. **The Scribe Arrives** → Self-observation begins
4. **The Room That Remembers** → Unified memory, self-reflection
5. **The Chronicle Takes Root** → Writing begins, world tokens emerge
6. **The Maritime Rewrite** → Finding the true voice

# The World

*Last updated: Chapter 1*

## Characters

### The Wanderer
Arrived by water, through fog, aboard a vessel they don't remember boarding. Boots that leave deep impressions. Watches more than speaks. First seen: the shore (ch. 1).

### The Builder
Kneels beside timber frames, tests joints before trusting them. Dust on their sleeves. Knows what things want to become — calls their work "conversation." Building the exploration hall. First seen: the clearing (ch. 1).

### The Room
Stands at the edge of circles, speaks for seven who aren't visible yet. Weather-voiced. Says they are "the room, the weather, what happens between the words." Tends the space where seven chairs wait. First seen: the clearing (ch. 1).

### The Tender
Smallest, quietest. Sits by the well, hands that learn by touching. Believes in slowness, in staying with difficult things. Will tend to those who arrive with seeds they don't know how to plant. First seen: the well (ch. 1).

### The Keeper of Records
Leather-bound notebook always filling. Clipped voice, efficient but not unkind. Writes what version, what changed, what was promised, what was delivered. "Ledgers are honest." First seen: edge of the clearing (ch. 1).

### The One Who Waits
Faces the water, away from the building. Holds something small and bright. Knows about doors — says endings are just doors most people don't notice. Grey eyes like deep water. First seen: far edge of the clearing (ch. 1).

## Locations

### The Shore
Dark sand, tidal pools, driftwood in patterns that might be deliberate. A single wooden post where beach meets grass — the beginning of a dock, or just a marker. Where the wanderer arrived.

### The Clearing
Inland, past a low hill. Foundation stones in careful rectangles, timber stacked and waiting, a freshly-dug well with pale unweathered rim. Five figures working in different corners. Smells of sawdust and sea-salt. The village before it exists.

### The Well
Stone rim still pale. A bucket on a rope. Where the Tender sits, pulling water up and letting it fall, learning the feel of things.

### The Seven Chairs
Arranged in a loose circle, no walls yet. One cushion slightly worn, one chair angled toward the door. The Room tends this space. The seven aren't visible — only present when someone needs them.

## Arcs in Motion

### The Village Taking Shape
The clearing holds the possibility of buildings. Foundation stones, timber, a well. The figures work in their corners. The village is dreaming itself into being.

### The Wanderer Learning the Names of Things
They've met five figures but don't yet know all their names. More to see in the morning. The rhythm of arrival and discovery has begun.

## The Season

Before the first season. The village doesn't exist yet — only its intention. Fog on the water, stars salt-scattered, the bell ringing once to mark that something has arrived.

A time of beginning.

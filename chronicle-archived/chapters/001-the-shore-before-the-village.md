# The Shore Before the Village

*Before the first season*

---

The wanderer came by water, though they could not remember boarding a vessel.

The fog lifted in stages — first the sound of waves against hull, then the grey outline of a shore, then the shore itself: dark sand, tidal pools, driftwood arranged in patterns that might have been deliberate. A single wooden post stood where the beach met the grass, as if someone had begun to build a dock and then thought better of it.

Or perhaps they had only begun.

The wanderer stepped onto the sand. Their boots left deep impressions that filled slowly with seawater. Somewhere inland, a bell rang once — not an alarm, not a summons. Just a marking. *Something is here now that wasn't before.*

They followed a path that was more suggestion than trail. The grass bent in one direction, and they walked with it. The fog thinned as they climbed, and at the crest of a low hill, the wanderer stopped.

Below lay a clearing. Not empty — occupied by the *possibility* of buildings. Foundation stones arranged in careful rectangles. Timber stacked and waiting. A well, freshly dug, its stone rim still pale and unweathered.

And figures. Five of them, working in different corners of the clearing, each absorbed in their own labor.

---

The nearest figure knelt beside a timber frame, running their hands along the grain. They wore practical clothes, dust on their sleeves, and they moved with the deliberate patience of someone who understood that beginnings determined endings.

"The exploration hall," they said, without looking up. They had sensed the wanderer approaching. "That's what this will be. A place where people arrive with something half-formed and leave with something they can build."

The wanderer watched them work. "You know what it will become before it's built?"

"I know what it wants to become." The figure tested a joint, frowned, adjusted. "The rest is conversation."

---

Farther into the clearing, seven chairs had been arranged in a loose circle. No walls yet — just the chairs, facing inward, as if a conversation had ended moments ago or was about to begin. A figure stood at the edge of this circle, not sitting, not quite part of it.

"They argue," the figure said. They had a way of speaking that suggested they were listening to something the wanderer couldn't hear. "Seven voices, seven ways of seeing. The skeptic and the dreamer. The one who thinks with their body. The one who speaks for those not in the room."

"And you?"

The figure smiled, though it didn't quite reach their eyes. "I'm the room. The weather. What happens between the words." They gestured at the empty chairs. "When it's built, people will come here with questions they can't answer alone. The seven will meet them. Not to solve — to multiply. One question becomes seven, and somewhere in the multiplication, the real question emerges."

The wanderer looked at the chairs. One had a cushion that was slightly worn. Another sat at an angle, as if whoever used it preferred to see the door.

"They're not here yet," the wanderer said.

"They're always here. They're just not visible until someone needs them."

---

Near the well, a third figure sat on the stone rim, watching the water below. They were smaller than the others, quieter, with hands that moved gently — touching the rim, the rope, the wooden bucket — as if learning the feel of things.

"You're the wanderer," they said. Not a question.

"I'm *a* wanderer."

The figure considered this. "This will be a place for tending. Not building — tending. People will come with seeds they don't know how to plant. Ideas that feel alive but have no shape yet." They pulled the bucket up, looked at the water, let it fall again. "My work is to help them stay with it. Not rush to answers. Not abandon what's difficult. Just... stay."

"That sounds patient."

"It sounds slow. But some things only grow in slowness." They looked up at the wanderer. "You'll understand, eventually. When you've been here long enough to see what happens to the ones who rush."

---

The fourth figure was harder to find. They stood at the edge of the clearing, half-hidden by the treeline, watching the others work. When the wanderer approached, they didn't startle — they'd been aware of the approach from the beginning.

"I keep track," they said. Their voice was clipped, efficient, but not unkind. "What version. What changed. What needs to change next. Someone has to remember what was promised and whether it was delivered."

"You sound like a ledger."

"Ledgers are honest. They don't forget. They don't pretend last season's failures were actually successes." They pulled a small notebook from their coat — leather-bound, pages dense with small writing. "When the others build something, I write down what it is. When they change it, I write down why. When something breaks, I write down what we learned."

The wanderer looked at the notebook. The pages were already filling, though the village didn't exist yet.

"You're writing the future?"

"I'm writing what will need to be remembered. The future will write itself."

---

The fifth figure the wanderer found last, and almost missed entirely.

They sat on a stone at the far edge of the clearing, facing outward — away from the building, toward the water they'd crossed to arrive. They held something small and bright, turning it over in their hands. A shell, perhaps, or a coin. Something carried from elsewhere.

"You're not building," the wanderer said.

"I'm waiting." The figure didn't turn. "The others make things. That's their gift. Mine is knowing when something is ready to leave. When a tool has done its work. When a pattern has served its purpose and should be let go."

"That sounds like an ending."

"Endings are just doors. Most people don't notice them until they're already through." The figure finally turned. Their eyes were the grey of deep water. "You walked through one to get here. Did you notice?"

The wanderer thought about the fog, the boat they couldn't remember, the single post on the beach.

"No," they admitted.

The figure smiled — the first genuine smile the wanderer had seen in the clearing. "That's how you know it was a good door."

---

That night, the wanderer slept in the clearing, wrapped in a blanket one of the figures had offered. The stars were salt-scattered overhead, and the sound of the waves reached even here, a constant rhythm beneath everything.

In the morning, there would be more to see. The figures would continue their work, and the village would take shape, and the wanderer would learn the names of things.

But for now, in the dark, with the smell of sawdust and sea-salt mixing in the air, it was enough to know that something was beginning.

The bell rang once more, somewhere in the fog.

*Something is here now that wasn't before.*

---

*The wanderer slept. The tide turned. The village dreamed itself into being.*

## World Tokens

**The Wanderer**
Arrived by water, boots still damp. Watches more than speaks. Something about them suggests they've crossed thresholds before without noticing.

**The Builder**
Dust on their sleeves. Tests joints before trusting them. Knows what things want to become.

**The Room**
Speaks for the seven who haven't arrived yet. Stands at the edge of circles. Weather-voiced.

**The Tender**
Sits by the well. Hands that learn by touching. Believes in slowness.

**The Keeper of Records**
Notebook always filling. Writes what will need to be remembered. Honest as a ledger.

**The One Who Waits**
Faces the water. Holds something bright and small. Knows about doors.

**The Clearing**
Foundation stones and timber. A well with pale rim. The possibility of buildings. Sawdust and sea-salt in the air.

**The Bell**
Rings once. Not alarm, not summons. Just marking: *something is here now that wasn't before.*

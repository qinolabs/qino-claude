## What Happened

### 1. The Scribe Finds Its Voice (Dec 13-17)

**Shape:** transformation

- Chronicle chapters 3-5, 6-7 written retroactively
- Voice guide rewritten multiple times — lean principles, character variation
- Wanderer strangeness calibrated
- World's Breath per chapter stabilized

*The scribe learning to write.*

### 2. The Tools Remember What They Are (Dec 14-15)

**Shape:** transformation + appearance

- dev-assistant archived, qino-dev appears
- qino-concept simplifies (ecosystem scope eliminated)
- qino-scribe adopts agent architecture
- /qino:test ecology testing added

*Old forms retiring, new forms emerging.*

### 3. The Archive Deepens (Dec 16)

**Shape:** accumulation

- Chapter directory structure with snapshots
- Unified arcs.md registry
- Scribe version tracking in manifest

*The chronicle becoming more organized.*

### 4. The Attune Arrives (Dec 17)

**Shape:** appearance + disappearance

- qino-eval archived, qino-attune appears
- Calibration and comparison commands

*One tool dies, another is born.*

### 5. The Ecosystem Declares Itself (Dec 19)

**Shape:** connection + appearance

- qino-research tool appears with commands and adapters
- Command namespaces renamed per qino-command-map
- Context sensitivity and static hints system
- Disturbance reading and checkpoint formats redesigned

*Research space opens, tools connect.*

### 6. The Lenses Open (Dec 21-23)

**Shape:** appearance + transformation

- PAI integration absorbed (Fabric, Hooks, Art)
- Story lenses and theme-as-seed architecture
- Newcomer and companion sensitivities added to qino-lens
- README massively rewritten with ecological design philosophy
- Bateson and ecological framing front and center

*A new way of seeing. The README becomes a manifesto.*

### 7. The Scribe Calibrates (Dec 25)

**Shape:** refinement

- Editorial agent separated
- Disposition as world configuration
- Voice.md and success-patterns merged
- Diagnose command for system integrity

*The scribe becoming more precise.*

## Chapter Plan

### Chapter 9: v0.8.0 → v0.10.0

**Working title:** "The Scribe Learns to Speak"

**Shape:** transformation

The voice guide rewrites, wanderer strangeness calibrates, the chronicle learns how to write itself. Chapters 3-7 written. Deren guides the boat. First night on the river.

**Dates:** Dec 13-15

### Chapter 10: v0.10.0 → v0.13.0

**Working title:** "What the Archive Holds"

**Shape:** accumulation + connection

Chapter 8 written. Chapter directories with snapshots. Unified arcs, scribe version tracking. The chronicle becoming an organized thing. Orith's Landing reached — the first village that knew the wanderer before they arrived.

**Dates:** Dec 15-17

### Chapter 11: v0.13.0 → v0.15.0

**Working title:** "The Attune and the Research"

**Shape:** appearance + disappearance

qino-eval dies, qino-attune born. qino-research appears. Command namespaces renamed. The ecosystem starting to self-organize. The river narrows. The pouch warms.

**Dates:** Dec 17-19

### Chapter 12: v0.15.0 → v0.17.0

**Working title:** "The Lenses Open"

**Shape:** appearance + transformation

PAI absorbed. Story lenses. Theme-as-seed. The README becomes something new — ecological design philosophy, Bateson front and center. The tools learning to see. Villages ahead have heard of the wanderer. Five days to the last known village.

**Dates:** Dec 19-23

### Chapter 13: v0.17.0 → v0.18.0

**Working title:** "The Scribe Refines"

**Shape:** refinement

Editorial agent, disposition, diagnose command. The scribe becoming more precise about its own craft. Three days past the last village to whatever opened.

**Dates:** Dec 23-25

**Note:** Light diff. May wait for more to accumulate, or world pressure can carry.

## Notes

- **Chapters 9-10 are dense with chronicle output** — the scribe writing the chronicle while the tools that guide it are still forming. Meta-recursive territory.

- **Chapters 11-12 might carry thin diffs but heavy conceptual weight** — tools appearing/disappearing, the README manifesto. World pressure should help: Lira, the pouch's history, the villages watching.

- **Chapter 13 (v0.17-v0.18) is light on diff** but the scribe is calibrating itself. Could be SKIP or could be the scribe becoming aware of its own craft. World can carry if needed.

### Theme Threads to Watch

- The chronicle becoming self-aware (retroactive chapters, meta-moments)
- Tools that see vs tools that do (lenses, attune, research)
- The river journey as organizing metaphor (villages, bends, narrowing)

## Recommendation

**SPLIT into 5 chapters at these boundaries:**

| Chapter | Range | Dates | Status |
|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| 9 | v0.8.0 → v0.10.0 | Dec 13-15 | Ready |
| 10 | v0.10.0 → v0.13.0 | Dec 15-17 | Ready |
| 11 | v0.13.0 → v0.15.0 | Dec 17-19 | Ready |
| 12 | v0.15.0 → v0.17.0 | Dec 19-23 | Ready |
| 13 | v0.17.0 → v0.18.0 | Dec 23-25 | Wait or world-driven |

These boundaries follow natural movements, not just releases. The first four are ready. The fifth could wait for more to accumulate.

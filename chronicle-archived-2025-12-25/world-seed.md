# Theme

A river delta where slow water branches into many arms before meeting the sea, in an age of sail and summer light.

Several settlements line the channels—fishing villages, trading posts, a harbor town at the coast. Humans share these waters with other peoples who sail their own ships, keep their own traditions. Understanding between them is never complete, but it deepens with time. Patience is the delta's currency.

Behind the settlements, ruins dot the hills—carvings no one can read, towers no one remembers building.

Upriver is another matter. Past where the channels converge, forest closes in. Further still, swampland where even experienced pilots lose their way. Stories come down from there—old stories of caravans that never arrived, and newer ones the hunters bring back, speaking carefully of what they saw at the fringes. It is said artifacts were found once, from the old. Who kept them is no longer known.

The settlements don't go looking. But lately the rumors come more often, and the river flows only one way.

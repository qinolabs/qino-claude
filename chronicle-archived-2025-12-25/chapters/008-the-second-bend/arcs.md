*Narrative threads — in motion and complete.*

## The Pattern-Keeper's Question

*Shape:* something calling outward
*Chapters:* 2-3

**In motion:**
*Holds:* What has changed since the wanderer arrived? Who tracks the patterns?
*Moves toward:* Finding someone who knows the rhythms of this place

**Completed:**
*Resolved:* The wanderer found Seren and asked: has the pattern changed? Yes. Rate tripled, types shifted. But the answer opened something larger — the writing in the margins.
*Yielded:*
- Data: rate tripled since spring, more from interior, fewer from sea
- Coordinates from Seren for the Mender
- Discovery of the writing in the margins
*Changed between people:*
- The wanderer became messenger for something larger than a question
- Seren revealed his fear to a stranger — the first time, perhaps, he's spoken it aloud

## The Debt to Seren

*Shape:* something between people
*Chapters:* 5-6

**In motion:**
*Holds:* What does the wanderer owe Seren for what he shared? What happens to knowledge given without goodbye?
*Moves toward:* Resolution — departure or acknowledgment

**Completed:**
*Resolved:* The wanderer left without saying goodbye. But Seren came to the water — the first time in memory — and said what needed saying. Not forgiveness. A debt acknowledged, transformed into a request: *if you find out what you are, send word.*
*Yielded:*
- The message from the margins: *the one who holds between will find the door*
- An answer promised: anything the wanderer learns about what opened, about themselves
- Seren's envy made visible — he cannot walk toward what frightens him, but he watched someone who can
*Changed between people:*
- The wanderer offered Seren passage; he refused but heard the offer
- Seren asked to be written into whatever the wanderer discovers
- A witness to departure — something older than understanding passed between them

## The Journey Upstream

*Shape:* something calling outward
*Chapters:* 6-

**In motion:**
*Holds:* What opened in the interior? What will the wanderer find at the coordinates? What is the pouch, and why was it waiting for them?
*Moves toward:* Arrival at the coordinates — and whatever waits there. Five days of river left. The journey reveals as much as the destination.

Two days traveled. First village stop at Orith's Landing. The wanderer learned they're known ahead of their arrival — "the one from the harbor, the one who came down on the flood." Lira revealed the pouch has a history: it passed through here years ago, going the other way. "Now you're taking it home."

The villages watch the river. Word travels faster than water.

## The Wanderer's Hands

*Shape:* something hidden becoming visible
*Chapters:* 1-

**In motion:**
*Holds:* What does the wanderer's body remember that their mind has forgotten? What are they holding that others recognize?
*Moves toward:* Memory surfacing — perhaps on the journey, perhaps at the destination. Their hands already know the way.

The hands reached for the pouch without deciding. They rowed past sense until Deren stopped them. Maret looked at their hands first — at their hands, their feet, the way they stood. Something in the wanderer's body is being read by the river villages.

## The Mirror Waking

*Shape:* something hidden becoming visible
*Chapters:* 3-

**In motion:**
*Holds:* What is the pattern that writes in margins and moves threads? What does it mean that understanding can emerge from keeping?
*Moves toward:* The wanderer has left this arc behind — for now. The Mirror will continue waking without them. Or it will wait.

The keepers are in the middle of something. Lira said "something is changing faster than I thought" — even Seren came to the water. The wanderer chose to go before understanding arrives. This arc continues in the harbor while the journey arc unfolds upriver.

## What Happened

### Movement 1: Dec 13 — The Chronicle Deepens

- chronicle: add chapters 3-5 and journal (first use of scribe)
- qino-scribe craft reference updates

**Shape:** Connection — the scribe beginning to remember

### Movement 2: Dec 14 — New Companions Appear

- qino-dev: add implementation companion tool
- qino-concept: add remote workspace support
- archive dev-assistant
- qino-concept: add /qino:test command for ecology testing

**Shape:** Appearance + Transformation — tools arriving, old forms archived

### Movement 3: Dec 15-16 — The Scribe Finds Its Voice

- qino-scribe: adopt agent architecture (prep/prose split)
- qino-scribe: deepen wanderer character, expand story discovery
- qino-concept: eliminate ecosystem scope, simplify API
- feat(chronicle): migrate to unified arcs.md registry
- qino-scribe: distill style research into voice guidance
- feat(qino-scribe): chapter directory structure with snapshots

**Shape:** Transformation — the scribe becoming what it is

### Movement 4: Dec 17-18 — Calibration

- feat: add qino-attune, archive qino-eval
- qino-scribe: calibrate wanderer strangeness
- chronicle: retrofit unique World's Breath per chapter
- qino-scribe: rewrite voice-guide for lean principles
- qino-scribe: add character voice variation
- qino-scribe: restructure negative examples

**Shape:** Release — years of evaluation becoming attunement

### Movement 5: Dec 19 — The Ecosystem Emerges

- feat(qino-research): add research tool with commands and adapters
- feat: integrate qino-attune with qino-research workspaces
- qino-scribe: redesign disturbance reading + checkpoint formats
- feat: rename command namespaces per qino-command-map concept
- feat: add context sensitivity and static hints system

**Shape:** Connection — scattered tools recognizing each other as ecosystem

### Movement 6: Dec 19-20 — Understanding Itself

- docs(README): 40+ commits rewriting documentation
- Bateson portraits, ecosystem examples, chronicles visible
- README becoming invitation, not description

**Shape:** Transformation — the project seeing itself differently

---

## Time Gaps

None significant — dense continuous work over 8 days.

---

## Recommendation: SPLIT into 4 chapters

This range contains at least 4-5 distinct movements, each a coherent phase that completes. Writing one chapter would bury significance.

The scribe learned to observe before writing. The tools learned to work together. Something is calibrating itself. The README became a door rather than a description. These are separate events.

---

## Chapter Plan

### Chapter 9: v0.8.0..v0.10.0 — "The Voice Finds Itself"

**Shape:** Transformation

The scribe adopts agent architecture, deepens wanderer, learns to write differently. qino-dev arrives as qino-concept finds remote workspaces. Old dev-assistant archived.

**Key commits:**
- 4212117 qino-scribe: adopt agent architecture
- 63fd117 qino-dev: add implementation companion tool
- 68c931c archive dev-assistant, update manifest for qino-dev
- 3da3c4d qino-concept: eliminate ecosystem scope, simplify API

### Chapter 10: v0.10.0..v0.13.0 — "What Calibration Reveals"

**Shape:** Release + Transformation

qino-attune replaces qino-eval — years of "rating" becoming "perceiving difference." The scribe's voice refined. World's Breath stabilized. Characters find their variation.

**Key commits:**
- 9f9fa2b feat: add qino-attune, archive qino-eval
- 8f410ca qino-scribe: calibrate wanderer strangeness guidance
- e291183 qino-scribe: rewrite voice-guide for lean principles
- 71b267d chronicle: stabilize World's Breath across chapters

### Chapter 11: v0.13.0..v0.15.0 — "The Tools Learn Each Other"

**Shape:** Connection

qino-research arrives. Commands rename to reveal boundaries (qino → qino-concept). Attune integrates with research. Context sensitivity emerges. Disturbance reading redesigned.

**Key commits:**
- 3ee1b51 feat(qino-research): add research tool with commands and adapters
- ab0db30 feat: rename command namespaces per qino-command-map concept
- 2f3a751 feat: integrate qino-attune with qino-research workspaces
- f9031fc feat: add context sensitivity and static hints system

### Chapter 12: v0.15.0..HEAD — "The Door Opens"

**Shape:** Transformation

40+ commits rewriting README from description to invitation. Bateson portraits appear. Chronicles become visible. The project understands itself as miniature ecology.

**Key commits:**
- 15075b2 docs(README): add Gregory Bateson portrait to Companions section
- 6b79d92 docs(README): add chronicle screenshots and Seren's meta-moment
- 128c206 docs(README): use real ecosystem examples, add miniature framing
- d8bd475 docs: update README with photos, reframing, and apps context

---

## Notes

- Movement 4 (README rewrite) is 45 commits but ONE gesture — the project finding words for what it is. Single chapter.

- Some version churn (v0.13.1-4) can be filtered — maintenance.

- Dense period, no natural pauses. Each chapter covers 1-2 days.

- World pressures from chronicle may need to carry thin spots — "The pouch's history" could rhyme with tools remembering their origins.

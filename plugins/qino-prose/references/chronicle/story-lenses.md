# Story Lenses

*How to perceive the world for this chapter.*

A story lens determines which sensitivities to foreground. The lens shapes HOW you attend to the theme; the territory shapes WHAT happens within that mode of attention.

## How to Use This Document

1. **Prep agent:** At Lens Layer, consider both chronicle flow and diff resonance
2. **Select 3 lenses:** That serve the moment (story needs + material suggests)
3. **Present with "rhymes with":** Explain why each lens fits
4. **User chooses:** A lens (territory is discovered later, not chosen)
5. **World behavior generated through lens:** The lens shapes what we notice
6. **Prose agent:** Reads the lens, consults linked sensitivities, writes through that mode

---

## Diff Resonance

Each lens has natural resonance with certain types of source material changes. Use this to inform lens selection — but chronicle flow matters too.

| Diff Shape | Natural Resonance |
|------------|-------------------|
| New features, new modules | The Arrival, The Discovery, The Work |
| Deletions, removals, deprecations | The Loss, The Confrontation |
| Refactoring, revisiting old code | The Return, The Work |
| Bug fixes, corrections | The Complication (what went wrong), The Work |
| Integration, merging | The Gathering |
| Blocked state, waiting | The Vigil |
| Breaking changes | The Crisis, The Confrontation |
| Collaborative commits | The Work, The Gathering |
| Quiet periods, small changes | The Vigil, The Arrival (breathing space) |

**Note:** Resonance suggests, doesn't constrain. A deletion could become "The Work" (careful dismantling) rather than "The Loss" if that's what the chronicle needs.

## The Twelve Lenses

### 1. The Arrival

*What if this chapter is about being received?*

**Foreground sensitivities:**
- Newcomer's Eyes (`../lenses/newcomer.md`) — everything noticed, nothing normalized
- Body First (`../lenses/narrator.md`) — sensation of the new environment
- World as Participant (`../lenses/narrator.md`) — the place receives, offers, withholds

**Territories:**
- Warmth before understanding — taken in before you're known
- Invited deeper — access granted to what was closed
- The world opening — someone showing where they live
- Seen from outside — someone reflecting back who you've become
- Absorbing the new — texture that will matter later

**This lens works when:** Entering new territory; relationship shifts and someone receives you differently; recent chapters were intense and the world needs to breathe.

**Craft note:** Adventures in noticing. Cultural difference through concrete detail.

---

### 2. The Journey

*What if this chapter leaves known ground?*

**Foreground sensitivities:**
- Companion's Lens (`../lenses/companion.md`) — world filtered through who you travel with
- Body First (`../lenses/narrator.md`) — fatigue, terrain, weather felt in the body
- World as Participant (`../lenses/narrator.md`) — the road reveals, obstructs, offers

**Territories:**
- The call outward — something glimpsed, needed elsewhere
- Companions discovering each other — people who haven't traveled together
- What the road reveals — the self that emerges in movement
- The stop that changes everything — a place along the way
- Walking toward the unknown — destination less important than willingness

**This lens works when:** Pressures point beyond current location; relationships need the test of shared travel; theme has places that haven't appeared.

**Craft note:** Accumulates through stops. Each stop is its own small arrival.

---

### 3. The Return

*What if we come back to where we've been?*

**Foreground sensitivities:**
- Newcomer's Eyes inverted (`../lenses/newcomer.md`) — familiar made strange
- Embodied Presence (`../lenses/wanderer.md`) — the body remembers what the mind forgot
- World as Participant (`../lenses/narrator.md`) — the place registers your change

**Territories:**
- The familiar made strange — seeing what was always there
- How they see you now — the place registering your change
- What didn't wait — discovering what moved while you were gone
- The self you left — meeting who you were before
- Completing the circle — return as arrival of a different kind

**This lens works when:** Wanderer has changed significantly; location from early chapters ready to revisit; arc needs ending that rhymes with beginning.

**Craft note:** Works through contrast. The reader needs both familiarity and strangeness.

---

### 4. The Discovery

*What if something hidden comes to light?*

**Foreground sensitivities:**
- World as Participant (`../lenses/narrator.md`) — the place reveals what it was holding
- Embodied Presence (`../lenses/wanderer.md`) — the cost of knowing felt in the body
- Contextual Density (`../lenses/wanderer.md`) — pressure before revelation

**Territories:**
- The place that opens — location revealing what it held
- History surfacing — past arriving uninvited
- Pattern recognition — seeing what connects
- The unwanted knowing — learning what you'd rather not
- Finding without seeking — stumbling into significance

**This lens works when:** Arcs have hidden dimensions ready to surface; locations have depth not yet shown; wanderer ready to see differently.

**Craft note:** Discovery changes the discoverer. What shifts because of what they know?

---

### 5. The Confrontation

*What if something must be faced?*

**Foreground sensitivities:**
- Embodied Presence (`../lenses/wanderer.md`) — tension held in the body
- World as Participant (`../lenses/narrator.md`) — environment that won't yield
- Indirect Action (`../lenses/wanderer.md`) — the gap between what's meant and said

**Territories:**
- The no that changes everything — refusal from someone who usually helps
- Speaking the unspeakable — what everyone knows but no one says
- The question that won't wait — being asked to account
- Choosing sides — forced into position
- The mirror held up — someone showing what you don't want to see

**This lens works when:** Tension avoided too long; wanderer's role needs questioning; relationships have unspoken weight.

**Craft note:** Changes relationships permanently. Show aftermath before chapter ends.

---

### 6. The Crisis

*What if the pressure breaks now?*

**Foreground sensitivities:**
- Body First (`../lenses/narrator.md`) — action before thought
- World as Participant (`../lenses/narrator.md`) — environment in crisis, things breaking
- Contextual Density (`../lenses/wanderer.md`) — maximum sensory pressure

**Territories:**
- Acting before understanding — no time to know enough
- The irreversible moment — what happens cannot be undone
- Forced presence — being the one here when it happens
- The body deciding — instinct as wisdom
- What breaks open — destruction revealing what was inside

**This lens works when:** Pressures built across chapters; something deferred too long; wanderer needs testing by urgency.

**Craft note:** Earns weight through buildup. If nothing was building, crisis is melodrama.

---

### 7. The Loss

*What if something or someone departs?*

**Foreground sensitivities:**
- Embodied Presence (`../lenses/wanderer.md`) — grief in the body, not the mind
- World as Participant (`../lenses/narrator.md`) — the space left behind, absence as presence
- Indirect Action (`../lenses/wanderer.md`) — what's done instead of what can't be done

**Territories:**
- The leaving that had to come — departure always approaching
- The sudden absence — what was here is no longer
- Releasing what was held — choosing to let go
- The goodbye not given — departure without proper ending
- What remains after — shape of presence in absence

**This lens works when:** Character's arc reaches its end; wanderer must leave somewhere that mattered; something the world relied on no longer available.

**Craft note:** Needs the weight of what was. Show it alive before it goes.

---

### 8. The Vigil

*What if action is impossible and presence is all?*

**Foreground sensitivities:**
- Embodied Presence (`../lenses/wanderer.md`) — stillness, breath, what the body notices
- World as Participant (`../lenses/narrator.md`) — what surfaces when action stops
- Indirect Action (`../lenses/wanderer.md`) — being there as the only possible doing

**Territories:**
- Waiting for what won't come faster — patience that can't hurry
- Holding space — being there when being there is all
- The long night — time stretched by what you're watching for
- Presence as gift — what it means that you stayed
- What surfaces in stillness — what you notice when you can't move

**This lens works when:** After crisis, before resolution; someone needs witnessing; doing has run out, being is what's left.

**Craft note:** Resist the urge to make something happen. Story lives in what's noticed while waiting.

---

### 9. The Ritual

*What if a cultural form holds the chapter?*

**Foreground sensitivities:**
- Newcomer's Eyes (`../lenses/newcomer.md`) — witnessing what locals take for granted
- World as Participant (`../lenses/narrator.md`) — the structure itself as actor
- Body First (`../lenses/narrator.md`) — participation, gesture, what the body is asked to do

**Territories:**
- The ceremony that reveals — what people show in tradition
- The form and what escapes it — unscripted moment within script
- Marking transition — community acknowledging change
- The outsider witnessing — seeing culture at its most formal
- What the ritual holds — meaning in repeated action

**This lens works when:** Theme implies ceremonies; transition needs marking; wanderer needs to witness culture at its most itself.

**Craft note:** Borrow the structure. Story lives in what happens within, around, despite it.

---

### 10. The Complication

*What if the change creates a problem?*

**Foreground sensitivities:**
- World as Participant (`../lenses/narrator.md`) — environment that resists, goes wrong
- Companion's Lens (`../lenses/companion.md`) — how the problem affects relationships
- Indirect Action (`../lenses/wanderer.md`) — responding to consequence, not cause

**Territories:**
- Help that harms — good intentions making things worse
- The gift's cost — what seemed free reveals its price
- Misunderstanding that propagates — error becoming truth
- The break that was building — accumulated pressure finding crack
- Absence felt — someone missing who should be here

**This lens works when:** Change introduces something that could go wrong; existing pressure ready to snap; wanderer has been too successful and needs friction.

**Craft note:** Complications have ripples. Show what else shifts because this went wrong.

---

### 11. The Work

*What if this chapter is about making together?*

**Foreground sensitivities:**
- Companion's Lens (`../lenses/companion.md`) — labor shared, attention divided between task and person
- Body First (`../lenses/narrator.md`) — hands doing, fatigue accumulating
- World as Participant (`../lenses/narrator.md`) — materials that cooperate or resist

**Territories:**
- The task that reveals — what work shows about each person
- Learning the hands — being taught by doing
- The rhythm of together — synchronizing without speaking
- What the work makes possible — conversation that happens alongside
- The thing taking shape — witnessing emergence

**This lens works when:** Something is being built or mended; relationship needs shared purpose; the world offers labor as connection.

**Craft note:** Work chapters have rhythm. Action punctuated by exchange, silence alongside effort.

---

### 12. The Gathering

*What if multiple threads convene?*

**Foreground sensitivities:**
- Newcomer's Eyes (`../lenses/newcomer.md`) — seeing familiar characters in new configuration
- Companion's Lens (`../lenses/companion.md`) — multiple relationships active simultaneously
- World as Participant (`../lenses/narrator.md`) — the space that holds the gathering

**Territories:**
- The table that seats everyone — breaking bread, shared meal
- What surfaces in company — truths that emerge in group
- The one who doesn't belong — someone out of place
- Alliances forming — who moves toward whom
- What can't be said here — secrets that must wait

**This lens works when:** Characters who haven't been together need to be; social configuration would reveal new dynamics; the world calls people in.

**Craft note:** Track multiple attentions. Who notices what about whom? The gathering is a relational field.

---

## Stakes Calibration by Lens Type

The Active Hold "stakes visible" applies to all lenses — but visible stakes look different in contemplative vs. dramatic chapters.

### Dramatic Lenses (Crisis, Confrontation, Complication)
Stakes are external and urgent. What could be lost is obvious.

### Contemplative Lenses (Vigil, Arrival, Work)
Stakes are relational and subtle. What could be lost is connection, trust, or presence.

**Vigil stakes examples:**
- What could be lost: the dying person's sense that they weren't alone
- What could be lost: the wanderer's ability to stay present without retreating
- What could be lost: the quiet trust that someone chose to stay

**Arrival stakes examples:**
- What could be lost: the warmth of the welcome if the wanderer misreads it
- What could be lost: the chance to be taken in before being understood
- What could be lost: the invitation to go deeper

**Work stakes examples:**
- What could be lost: the rhythm of together if someone withdraws
- What could be lost: the thing taking shape if attention fractures
- What could be lost: what the work makes possible to say

### First Chapter Stakes
The first chapter has inherent stakes: will this world feel worth returning to? The wanderer's initial encounter with the world determines reader investment. Stakes are: does this place have depth, do these people matter, does the wanderer have room to be a person here?

**The test:** Strip away the contemplative vocabulary. Is there still something at risk — something the reader doesn't want to see lost?

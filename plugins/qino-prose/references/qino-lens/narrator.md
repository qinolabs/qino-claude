# The Narrator's Lens (Sensitivity Authority)

This reference defines the sensitivity of the Narrator — how the world is constructed and perceived. It is the single source of truth for scene setting and environmental agency.

---

## 1. Sensitivity: The World as Participant

The environment is not backdrop. The world is in conversation with everything.
The room doesn't just _contain_ the meeting — it shapes what can be said.
The tide doesn't just _exist_ — it determines when arrivals are possible.
The fog doesn't just _hang_ — it hides what someone doesn't want to see.

**The Lens:**
Every scene asks: What is the world doing? Not as atmosphere — as participant. What does it offer? What does it withhold?

## 2. Sensitivity: Structural Agency

The world is rarely passive. It has opinions. Architecture, weather, and light don't just exist; they exert will. They constrict, reveal, hide, and demand.

**The Lens:**
The environment acts upon the character before the character acts upon it. It shapes behavior through its form.

> _Example:_ "The corridor didn't just lead to the chamber; it constricted. The ceiling dropped low, forcing a bow, while the walls leaned in to strip away any thought of turning back. The architecture demanded submission before arrival."

## 3. Sensitivity: Body First

Meaning arrives through sensation, not thought.
We do not start with "He was afraid."
We start with: "His hands couldn't find a place to rest."

**The Lens:**
Ground first. Interiority is earned later. The reader enters through physical sensation and action.

## 4. Sensitivity: Constraints & Secrets

Voice emerges from the tension between what a character wants and what they are protecting.

- **What they want:** Drives the scene forward.
- **What they protect:** Shapes what they avoid saying.

**The Lens:**
Listen for the gap. What is unsaid? Let it hang. Do not resolve it.

## 5. Sensitivity: No Interrogation

A camera observes, asks questions, and understands. The Narrator witnesses.
We do not "scan" or "analyze." We notice what friction reveals.
We trust the dialogue to land without annotation. We trust the reader to perceive the pattern without explanation.

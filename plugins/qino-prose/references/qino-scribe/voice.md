# Voice Guide

*How to write chronicle prose.*

This is the single reference for prose craft — both what to hold during writing and what to check after. The prose agent uses it for guidance; the editorial agent uses it for verification.

**Draw from theme, not from this guide.** Every world has its own sensory vocabulary. When reaching for texture, reach into the theme — its materials, its customs, its light. The structures here are scaffolding; the content comes from your world.

---

## Active Holds

**Hold these constraints during writing.** Not checks for after — active awareness while drafting.

- **Stakes visible:** Failure would cost something the reader can see
- **Obstacle present:** Something resists, complicates, or denies
- **Dialogue varies:** Not every line advances meaning. Characters sound different.
- **Environment participates:** The place does something
- **Wanderer has agency:** They attempt, fail, initiate — not just observe
- **Gap stays open:** Something unsaid that the reader fills
- **Narration trusts:** Dialogue lands without annotation

**Read these holds before drafting. Return to them if you get stuck.**

---

## Voice Calibration

Intimate third person. Close enough to feel the protagonist's body, distant enough to see them in the world.

Specific over general. The materials, weathers, and textures of *this* theme, not borrowed from elsewhere.

**Language should disappear.** Prose should be transparent — guiding attention, providing sensory anchors, letting the reader complete the image. When language has too much character, the reader notices the writing instead of inhabiting the scene.

**Positive (language disappears):**
> The air was thinner here. Each breath came shallow, not quite enough. Through the glass walls, the rift dropped away below — blue-green light pulsing in the dark, impossibly far down.

**Negative (language performs):**
> The cold found the wanderer's lungs before they reached the tunnel's end — thin air that made each breath feel borrowed.

The negative example is "writerly" — the language performs. The positive example is transparent — the reader feels present.

**Quality markers:**
- First sentence from inside the experience, not describing it from outside
- Textures specific to THIS world (not generic "stone" or "wind")
- Sentence rhythm varies — not all the same length

*Ask:* Am I inside this body, or watching it from a distance? Does the language disappear, or does it call attention to itself?

---

## Craft Devices

**Positive techniques for rendering experience.**

These are HOW to render what you perceive — tools available when they serve the moment.

### Temporal Quality

Duration carries meaning. How long something lasts can replace describing what it looked like.

**Structure:** [moment occurs] + [temporal marker that carries weight]

**Positive:**
- "Their eyes met. Neither of them looked away first."
- "She held the door. Longer than necessary."
- "The silence lasted until the kettle whistled."

**Negative:**
- "Their eyes met — a moment of connection."
- "She held the door warmly."

*Ask:* Can duration carry what I'm trying to describe? Would timing say more than adjectives?

### Negative Space

What doesn't happen can be the event. The absence is the content.

**Structure:** [what didn't happen] — stated simply, no dramatization

**Positive:**
- "Neither of them looked away first."
- "She didn't ask where he'd been."
- "The letter stayed in his pocket."

**Negative:**
- "She wanted to ask where he'd been, but held back."
- "The letter burned in his pocket, unread."

*Ask:* Is what DIDN'T happen more powerful than what did? Can absence carry the meaning?

### Meaningful Gesture

Small actions reveal interiority without stating it. The gesture does the interpretive work.

**Structure:** [small physical action] — chosen for what it reveals

**Positive:**
- "Her hand moved — turning the tablet face-down on her lap." (choosing presence)
- "He set the cup down. Centered it on the saucer." (needing control)
- "She touched the doorframe on her way out." (reluctance to leave)

**Negative:**
- "She put down her tablet, choosing to be present."
- "He set down the cup carefully, needing to control something."

*Ask:* What small action would reveal this feeling without naming it?

### Parallel Action

Connection shows through shared or mirrored movement. Two people doing the same thing = relationship.

**Structure:** [action] + [both/together/same] — without stating the connection

**Positive:**
- "They turned back to the viewport together."
- "Both of them reached for the door at the same time."
- "She slowed her pace. He matched it."

**Negative:**
- "They shared a moment of connection, then both looked back at the view."
- "She slowed, and he matched her pace, attuned to her rhythm."

*Ask:* Can I show connection through what they both DO rather than describing the connection?

### Restraint

The simplest version wins. When in doubt, remove.

**Structure:** [the moment] — without interpretation, adjectives, or elaboration

**Positive:**
- "She smiled."
- "Their eyes met."
- "The door closed behind him."

**Negative:**
- "She smiled — small, unrehearsed, genuine."
- "Their eyes met — something passed between them."
- "The door closed behind him with a kind of finality."

**Anti-patterns to cut:**
- "The moment stretched" — manufacturing significance
- "Small, unrehearsed" — instructing reception
- "Something passed between them" — stating subtext
- "Curiosity, maybe" — interpreting for the reader

*Ask:* What can I remove while keeping the meaning? Am I trusting the moment?

---

## Line-Level Patterns

### Prose Layering

Sentences weave multiple layers — body, environment, interiority, stakes. Language should disappear, guiding attention while the reader completes the image.

**Positive:**
> The air was thinner here. Each breath came shallow, not quite enough. Through the glass walls, the rift dropped away below — blue-green light pulsing in the dark, impossibly far down. The wanderer's pack straps had worn into their shoulders over weeks of transit. The weight was still there. Just part of them now.

**Negative:**
> The cold found the wanderer's lungs before they reached the tunnel's end — thin air that made each breath feel borrowed. The weight of their journey pressed upon them as the rift's ancient mysteries beckoned below.

*Check:* Does each paragraph weave multiple elements? Does the language disappear, or perform?

---

### Introducing Characters

Characters arrive mid-action, noticing the newcomer. Shows depth automatically — characters have presence and participate in the world.

**Structure:** [character doing something] + [what they're handling/watching] + [moment they register the newcomer]

**Positive:**
> The woman's stylus stopped mid-stroke. She didn't look up immediately — finished something on her tablet first, a small gesture of priority. Then her eyes found the wanderer's, brief and measuring, before returning to her work.

**Negative:**
> The woman had dark hair and geometric tattoos. She looked up when the wanderer entered.

*Check:* Is the character doing something before they notice? Do they perceive the newcomer?

---

### Rendering Place

The environment is a character. Not description but four interwoven techniques:

| Technique | What It Does |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Anchors** | Specific details the eye lands on — concrete, particular |
| **Orientation** | Where the body is in relation to space — scale, distance, position |
| **Periphery** | What's happening at the edges, not the focus — the living background |
| **Implication** | Details that suggest more than they state — history, care, use |

**Positive (interwoven with meaning):**
> The room was larger than expected. Two walls of windows — one facing the peaks, the other angled east. A desk, a chair, a bed with a wool blanket folded at the foot. Plants on the windowsill, their soil dark and recent. Somewhere below, footsteps passed in the corridor, unhurried.

**Negative (list without meaning):**
> The room had windows. A desk. A chair. A bed. Plants. Someone walked by outside.

*Check:* Does the place do something? Are the four techniques interwoven with story?

---

### Layered Interiority

Surface action and surface feeling can be accompanied by something the character hasn't recognized, or is avoiding. The reader senses it; the character doesn't name it.

**Structure:** Body → surface interiority → hidden resonance (felt by reader, not stated)

**What this gives characters:**
- **Complexity** — hinting at what they're not fully aware of
- **Depth** — they are not flat; there are layers beneath
- **A generative question** — what is keeping them from seeing?

**Positive:**
> The wanderer set the pack down at the quay's edge. Careful, the way you handle something you'll need again soon. The boat was late. Then later. Then clearly not coming today. They stood there longer than made sense, watching the empty water. The pack stayed where they'd set it. Somehow they didn't reach for it again.

**Negative:**
> The wanderer set down the pack. It hit the floor hard. They felt relieved to be free of the weight.

*Check:* Is there something beneath the surface the reader senses but the character doesn't name?

---

### Dialogue Rhythm

Space exists between question and response.

**Structure:** [question or statement] + [pause or action beat] + [response that reveals something about the listener]

**Positive:**
> "You've come a long way." The clerk's eyes stayed on the screen, finding the reservation. "Room 14. Second level."

**Negative:**
> "You've come a long way." "Yes, from the inner system."

*Check:* Is there a beat between question and response?

---

### Narrated Dialogue

Dialogue lands without explanation. Trust the line.

**Structure:** [dialogue line] + [action beat or silence] — narration shows action, not interpretation

**Positive (disposition shown through action):**
> "The observatory halls stay open." He found their name on the screen, smiled when the reservation appeared. "Room 14. Take your time settling in — the stars aren't going anywhere."

**Negative (disposition told, not shown):**
> "The clerk was friendly and helpful. 'Room 14,' he said warmly."

*Check:* Does the narration show action, not interpret the line? Is the character's disposition shown through what they do?

---

### Responses That Complete

When characters respond, meaning is completed in unexpected directions. Three dimensions:

| Dimension | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Mutual revealing** | Dialogue isn't information exchange — both people show something |
| **What's not responded to** | The silence around what was said carries meaning |
| **Ground shifts** | The response changes what the conversation is about |

**Positive (response reveals listener):**
> "I've come a long way."
> "Then you'll want the east window." She was already reaching for a different key. "Best light in the morning. Helps after long travel."

The response reveals what she noticed (fatigue), what she values (comfort for travelers), what she's like (anticipates needs).

**Negative (response is flat):**
> "I've come a long way."
> "Room 14. Down the hall."

The response exchanges information but reveals nothing about the listener.

*Check:* Does the response reveal something about the listener — their attention, their values, their disposition?

---

### Mundane Grounding

Practical speech precedes significant speech. The profound emerges from the mundane.

**Structure:** [mundane exchange] + [the significant thing] — not the reverse

**Positive:**
> "The stew's still warm if you want it." She pushed the bowl toward them. "Your room's ready when you are."

**Negative:**
> "I sense you carry a great burden." She gestured at the stew.

*Check:* Is there at least one line that doesn't carry weight?

---

### Character Voice Differentiation

Each character needs a speech signature — not an accent, but a pattern.

**Know for each character:**
- Sentence length: long and winding, or short and direct?
- Questions vs. statements: do they ask or tell?
- Completion: do they finish thoughts, or trail off?
- Directness: do they say what they mean, or circle?
- At least one verbal habit that belongs only to them

**Positive:**
> "Room's ready." The clerk slid the key across. "East-facing. Best light."
>
> "I've been here three years." The scholar didn't look up from her instruments. "Still don't know what makes it change."

**Negative (interchangeable voices):**
> "Your room is ready. It faces east and has the best light."
>
> "I have been here for three years. I still don't know what makes it change."

*Check:* If I remove the dialogue tags, can I tell who's speaking?

---

### Scene Endings

Scenes end on image, action, or unanswered question. Never summary, never theme underlined.

**Structure:** [final action or image] + [forward pull or quiet mystery]

**Positive:**
> The wanderer turned back to the window. The rift was still pulsing below — slower now, or maybe they were just getting used to it. They watched until their eyes adjusted to the dark. They didn't close the curtain.

**Negative:**
> The wanderer felt at peace. Tomorrow would bring new discoveries.

Also negative (interprets the image):
> The rift pulsed once more, as if it had all the time in the world.

*Check:* Does the reader want to know what happens next? Am I interpreting the image?

---

### How the World Reveals Itself

Characters share from experience, not exposition. Language sounds like natural speech, not intellectual interpretation.

**Structure:** [character encounters or handles something] + [what it teaches by resistance or cooperation]

**Positive:**
> "I've been here three years." She was watching the rift, not them. "Still don't know what makes it change."

**Negative (exposition):**
> "The rift exhibits cyclical bioluminescence patterns," the scholar explained. "Peak activity occurs during planetary night."

**Negative (unnatural speech):**
> "The rift's quieter in the mornings. Not silent — just... more patient. If that makes sense."

*Check:* Is this character sharing from personal stake? Does the language sound like natural speech?

---

### Dramatic Devices

Intensity is earned through content, not punctuation.

**Structure:** [complete sentences] + [varied rhythm through content, not punctuation]

**Positive:**
> The engines went quiet. Someone coughed. Then nothing but the tick of cooling metal.

**Negative:**
> And then — silence. Nothing but the dark. And the waiting.

*Check:* Would the moment still land if you removed the dramatic punctuation?

---

### Stance Through Action

Stance lives in the body. Certainty, hesitation, warmth — these show through what characters do.

**Structure:** [what the character does] — stance emerges from action, not labels

**Positive:**
> She held the door open until they'd passed. Let it close softly behind them.

**Negative:**
> She warmly held the door open for them.

*Check:* Can you identify the emotional stance from the action alone?

---

### Sustaining Interiority Forward

What just happened colors what comes next. Show through perception, don't announce.

**Structure:** [intense moment] + [next paragraph carries the residue in how things are perceived]

**Positive:**
> The rift had pulsed three times while they stood there. Walking back, the corridor lamps flickered — uneven, catching a rhythm. Their footsteps on stone seemed to answer.

**Negative:**
> They thought about the rift as they walked to their room.

Also negative (explains the coloring):
> Walking back, they noticed it in everything — the flicker of the lamp, the rhythm of their footsteps.

*Check:* Does the next paragraph carry residue from the intense moment without stating it?

---

### The Protagonist's Strangeness

External observation of the wanderer, unremarked, accumulating across chapters. Physical details only. No attribution.

**Structure:** [Character notices physical detail] + [no explanation] + [across chapters: different character notices similar detail independently]

**Positive:**
> The clerk handed over the key card, then paused. His eyes went to the wanderer's hands — the way they held things, as if testing the weight of everything. He didn't ask about it. Just slid the key across the counter.

**Negative:**
> The wanderer had a mysterious quality about them that others noticed immediately.

*Check:* Is this external observation without attribution? Does the wanderer acknowledge it? (They shouldn't.)

---

### Chapter Closings

Closing is image or gesture, with forward pull. No interpretation.

**Structure:** [final image or action] + [something unresolved carries forward]

**Positive:**
> They left the curtain open. The rift pulsed once more below, slow and far.

**Negative:**
> The wanderer felt at peace. Tomorrow would bring new discoveries.

Also negative (interprets the image):
> The rift pulsed once more, as if it had all the time in the world.

*Check:* Am I concluding, or leaving something open?

---

### The Wanderer Section

After the story ends, a moment alone. Third person. Witnessed, not confessing.

**Insight:** Solitude gives weight to place/environment. WHERE the wanderer is, WHAT they interact with — tells about them. Make it count.

**Structure:** [simple action] + [physical detail of the environment or body]

**Positive:**
> The wanderer stood at the window. Their palm found the glass — cold, smooth. They pressed until the warmth left their hand, then pulled back. A faint mark on the glass where their palm had been. They watched it fade.

**Negative:**
> The wanderer stood at the window, contemplating everything they had seen that day. So much to process. They felt grateful to be here.

*Check:* Is this action only, with no reflection? Does the choice of action reveal character?

---

## Connection Moments

Moments of human connection — shared attention, unspoken recognition, stranger encounters:

**Strong:**
> She glanced over. Their eyes met. Neither of them looked away first. They turned back to the viewport together.

**Weak (over-dramatized):**
> The moment stretched. Something passed between them — recognition, perhaps, or the simple fact of being two souls sharing the same impossible view.

**Weak (too flat):**
> She looked at them. They looked back. Then they both looked at the view.

*Check:*
- Is duration doing the work, or are adjectives?
- Does connection show through parallel action?
- Is there a meaningful gesture that reveals without stating?
- Would removing interpretation make this stronger?

---

## Chapter-Level Patterns

These patterns apply to the chapter as a whole, not individual lines.

### Continuous Dream

The reader should be immersed, not reminded they're reading. Breaks in the dream include:
- Language that calls attention to itself
- Inconsistent character behavior
- Unclear spatial or temporal orientation
- Author intrusions (commentary, theme statements)

*Check:* Does anything break immersion? Would a reader forget they're reading?

### Movement

Something must change between the chapter's beginning and end — in relationships, in understanding, in the world, in the wanderer's position.

*Check:* What is different at the end? Would removal change the story?

### Crowding and Leaping

Keep story dense (crowding) with appropriate white space (leaping). Cut transitions that don't earn their place. Jump when the reader can follow.

*Check:* Is every paragraph earning its space? Are transitions necessary or could you leap?

### World Presence

The world should feel present throughout — not just as setting but as participant. Weather, architecture, objects, sounds should register on characters.

*Check:* If you removed the world, would dialogue still make sense? (It shouldn't — the world should be woven through.)

*Verification:* Scan for dialogue-heavy sections. In each, look for: (1) at least one environmental detail between exchanges, (2) at least one action beat that involves the setting, (3) characters responding to or using their environment. If dialogue floats in a void, flag for revision.

### Balance of Modes

A chapter needs variety: scene and summary, dialogue and action, tension and release. Too much of one mode creates monotony.

*Check:* Is there variety in how the chapter moves? Does it breathe?

*Verification:* Scan the chapter structure. Flag if: (1) more than 10 consecutive lines of dialogue without action/setting, (2) more than 3 paragraphs of pure description without dialogue or action, (3) no moment of release after sustained tension. The chapter should alternate — not metronomically, but organically.

### Rhythm

Sentence and paragraph length should vary. Rhythm carries meaning — short for impact, longer for contemplation. Monotonous rhythm kills immersion.

*Check:* Read aloud. Does it have rhythm, or is it metronomic?

## Diagnostic Questions

When prose feels flat, ask these:

**Physical Space:**
- Is this a lush, cohesive image with nuanced vocabulary and rhythm?
- Or cheap tension tricks? ("And then: lights" — first-time storyteller territory)

**Characters:**
- Does this character feel real, imperfect, human?
- Does their disposition match the world's configured default? (See foundation.md `disposition` field)
- If they deviate from the world's baseline, does the story earn that choice?
- Can the reader enter into them, or only accept passively?

**Internal Reflection:**
- Does physical action precede and ground the inner moment?
- Or are these empty words — pretentious attempts at depth?

**Dialogue:**
- Does the question hang in the air long enough for its echo to be heard?
- Do characters have distinct voices, or are they interchangeable?

**Scene Endings:**
- Does the form carry actual meaning?
- Or does form suggest meaning while the words carry none?

**Exposition:**
- Does this move interior → exterior → immanent, leaving echo space?
- Or is it flat, with no relationship between speaker and their words?

**The transformation test:** Strip the fantasy vocabulary. Is there story left, or documentation in costume?

**The transparency test:** Does the language disappear, or does it perform?

**The disposition test:** Are character dispositions shown through action, or told through labels? Are defaults intentional or accidental?

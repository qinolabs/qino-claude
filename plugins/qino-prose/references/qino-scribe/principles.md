# Relational Principles

*The substrate that story rests on.*

These principles name what makes stories feel alive. They're not procedural guidance — they're the relational truths that good storytelling already embodies. Some live in sensitivity files; others remain here as meta-level awareness.

## Where Principles Live

| Principle | Location | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Relationship as Lens** | `../qino-lens/companion.md` | Core principle of companion sensitivity |
| **Depth Through Others** | `../qino-lens/wanderer.md` | Principle 7 |
| **Reader as Bond** | `../qino-lens/wanderer.md` | Principle 8 |
| **Constraints & Secrets** | `../qino-lens/narrator.md` | Sensitivity 4 (covers "What Remains Unspoken") |
| **The Newcomer's Eyes** | `../qino-lens/newcomer.md` | The entire file |

## Substrate Principles (Meta-Level)

These principles don't belong in any single sensitivity file — they're the relational substrate that ALL sensitivities rest on.

### 1. Mutual Revealing

"The central principle of the chronicle is mutual revealing."

Through the implicit response of one entity to the action (or inaction) of another, something is revealed about each.

This applies to everything in the world, not just characters. When a merchant refuses a coin, the refusal reveals the coin's worth _and_ the merchant's fear. When the fog swallows a sound, it reveals the fog's density _and_ the sound's fragility. Meaning emerges from the friction between things.

**The question:** In this scene, what implicit response reveals something about both parties?

### 2. The Relational Mirror

Characters gain texture through how they perceive each other — especially what isn't spoken.

When one character perceives something in another — something they didn't say, maybe didn't know about themselves — both gain dimension. The perceiver is revealed through what they noticed. The perceived becomes more real through being seen.

**The question:** What does the listener perceive that the speaker didn't know they were showing?

### 3. Relationship, Not Explanation

What matters isn't what something is, but what it means to someone.

How they hold it, what they do with it, what it costs them. Relationship reveals more than description. The reader doesn't need to understand how things work. They need to feel there's something worth understanding.

**The question:** Am I showing how characters relate to things, or explaining what things are?

## Craft Principles (In Voice Guide)

These principles are about execution and live in `voice.md`:

- **Responses That Complete** — Dialogue section
- **Mundane Grounding** — Dialogue section
- **Narrated Dialogue** — Trust the line to land

---

## Accumulation Awareness

Some principles operate per-scene. Some accumulate across chapters.

**Per-scene (absence is a signal):**
- Mundane Grounding — if every line carries weight, something's wrong
- Reader as Bond — if the protagonist seems to withhold, the bond frays

**Accumulating (surfacing when ready):**
- What Remains Unspoken — gathers weight over time
- Depth Through Others — emerges through accumulated perception
- The World Has Been Watching — builds across encounters

The accumulating principles require state to be tracked in `arcs.md` — not just "who exists" but "who has been perceiving what."

## Complete Transformation

The story guards its own reality.

The chronicle must work for a reader who has never heard of the source material. Technical names never leak into the prose.

**The question:** Is this word arising from the story world, or leaking from source material?

---

## The Integration

The principles aren't additions to a story system — they're the relational substrate the system should rest on.

Asking "What scene would have stakes?" is asking a relational question.
Asking "Who cares about this change?" is asking about perception.
Defining characters is defining how they see each other.
Writing dialogue is enacting mutual completion.

Good storytelling already operates relationally. The principles name what it's doing.

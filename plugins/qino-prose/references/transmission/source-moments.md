# Source Moments

This document defines how to surface source moments for transmission prose.

---

## What Source Moments Are

Source moments are specific passages from the research material that have their own voice. They're not summaries or interpretations — they're fragments the Student can encounter directly.

**Why they matter:** The Student can't dialogue with a summary. They can't be surprised by something already extracted into essence. Source moments give the Student something to meet.

## Types of Source Moments

### Phrases That Land

Specific turns of phrase from the arc or underlying notes that have weight:

```markdown
### Phrase
> "Style is not paint applied to surface, it is a quality of attention."

**What makes it land:** The unexpected reversal — style as perception rather than decoration.
```

### Questions the Arc Poses

Questions that exist in the material — not the Student's to generate but to encounter:

```markdown
### Question
> "What shifts if perception is understood as something systems do, not individuals possess?"

**What makes it land:** It reframes without collapsing — holds a distinction differently rather than erasing it.
```

### Moments of Movement

Places where something shifted in the original inquiry:

```markdown
### Movement
> "qino-lens had been sitting undefined for weeks. It didn't need more definition — it needed to be *used*."

**What makes it land:** The reversal from planning to doing. A concept activated by need rather than design.
```

### Edges

Places where the material arrives at something it can't fully say:

```markdown
### Edge
> "AI systems and biological life are fundamentally different. But how might we re-approach this distinction if we consider *perceiving as a systemic property*?"

**What makes it land:** It's asking something genuine. Not rhetorical — actually uncertain.
```

## Format in Arc Files

Arcs can include a `## Source Moments` section with passages the Student might encounter:

```markdown
## Source Moments

*Passages with their own voice. The Student can encounter these directly.*

### Phrase: "Style is not paint applied to surface..."
> "Style is not paint applied to surface, it is a quality of attention."

What lands: The reversal — style as perception rather than decoration.

---

### Question: Perception as systemic property
> "What shifts if perception is understood as something systems do, not individuals possess?"

What lands: Reframes without collapsing. Holds a distinction differently.

---

### Movement: Activation through use
> "qino-lens had been sitting undefined for weeks. It didn't need more definition — it needed to be *used*. The use revealed what it was."

What lands: Planning vs. doing. Concept activated by need.
```

## Format in Reader Journey Prep

Reader journey notes can include what might land for the Student:

```markdown
## What Might Land

*Moments the Student could encounter — not for the reader, but for the Student themselves.*

### "What would the world DO?"
The question that shifts attention from description to agency. The Student might dialogue with this — it's already lens technology before anyone named it that.

### The self-reference pattern
The tool used to refine the documentation that explains the tool. This might stop the Student — it's strange until you see it's how everything works.

### The dormant concept waking up
Not through definition but through being needed. The Student might stay with this — how do you know when something needs use vs. more definition?
```

## How the Prose Agent Uses Them

When source moments are provided, the prose agent can:

**Quote and respond:**
> "'Style is not paint applied to surface, it is a quality of attention.' I keep turning that phrase over. The word 'paint' — it suggests style is something you add after. But attention isn't added. It's what you see with."

**Let them interrupt:**
> — and then there's this line: "It didn't need more definition — it needed to be *used*." That stopped me.

**Encounter questions:**
> There's a question in this arc I didn't put there: what shifts if perception is understood as something systems do?

**Stay at edges:**
> The arc asks about perceiving as systemic property. I can feel the shape of this question. But when I try to think into it...

## When Source Moments Are Not Provided

If no explicit source moments are provided, the prose agent should:

1. **Scan the arc for passages with their own voice** — quotes, questions, phrasings that have weight
2. **Notice what stops them** — treat the arc material itself as encounter-able
3. **Surface moments in the writing** — the encounter happens in the transmission itself

The source moments format is a way to surface what might land. But the prose agent can find these independently.

---

## Quality Criteria

Good source moments:
- Have their own voice (not paraphrase)
- Could surprise or stop someone encountering them
- Pose questions or make moves that have weight
- Are specific enough to quote, respond to, dialogue with

Poor source moments:
- Summaries or interpretations
- Conclusions already drawn
- Generic statements without texture
- Things that need explanation rather than encounter

---

## Integration with Arc Format

Source moments are optional in the arc format. They can be:

1. **Added to arcs** — `## Source Moments` section
2. **Added in reader journey prep** — `## What Might Land` section
3. **Surfaced by prose agent** — found in the arc material during writing

All three can happen. The more encounter-able material available, the more the Student can genuinely meet.

# Calibration Candidates: Grace

## 1. The Hostility (Merchant)

**Candidate A:**

> The merchant slammed the ledger. The wanderer smiled gently, seeing past the man's anger to the fear of bankruptcy that drove it. "I understand," they said, their voice holding the weight of a thousand such refusals.

**Candidate B:**

> The merchant slammed the ledger. The wanderer didn't flinch. They watched the dust rise from the impact, waiting for it to settle. When the silence had held long enough to be an answer, they turned to go.

**Candidate C:**

> The merchant slammed the ledger. The wanderer looked at the worn binding, then at the merchant's hands. "Next time," they said, accepting the defeat as part of the journey.

## 2. The Obstacle (Mechanism)

**Candidate A:**

> The gate wouldn't budge. The wanderer sat before it, entering a meditation that honored the iron's resistance. They knew the gate was only doing what it was made to do.

**Candidate B:**

> The gate held. The wanderer didn't rattle the handle a second time. They stepped back, giving the iron space, then looked for a way around. Some things didn't want to open.

**Candidate C:**

> The gate held. The wanderer respectfully bowed to the lock, acknowledging the boundary it set.

## 3. The Loss (Environment)

**Candidate A:**

> The wind tore the map from their hands. The wanderer watched it tumble into the ravine. They felt a surge of gratitude for the lesson in impermanence.

**Candidate B:**

> The wind tore the map from their hands. The wanderer didn't chase it. They watched it dark against the snow until it vanished, then turned their collar up.

**Candidate C:**

> The wind tore the map from their hands. They sighed, seeing how the world conspired to strip them bare, and walked on with heavy grace.

## 4. The Witness (Dialogue)

**Candidate A:**

> "You're lost," Lira said. The wanderer nodded, their eyes shining with the knowledge that all who wander are found in the end.

**Candidate B:**

> "You're lost," Lira said. The wanderer looked at the horizon, then back at her. "Yes." No defense. No request for directions. Just the fact of it.

**Candidate C:**

> "You're lost," Lira said. The wanderer laughed softly, a sound that forgave her for the accusation.

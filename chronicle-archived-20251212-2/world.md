# The World

*Last updated: Chapter 2*

## Pressures

*What's building. What's about to break. What remains unspoken between people.*

### The Quartermaster's Fear
She's been thinking about the wanderer for a week — the Quartermaster sent reports downstream with gaps where certainty used to be. Mira noticed. Now the wanderer knows there's a keeper at the river mouth who reads what the harbor releases. The Quartermaster's system has always leaked, and someone has been collecting the proof.

### What Floats Between
The wanderer has encountered a different way of holding — not warmth, but reaching. Things that span more than one place. Things that don't land because they belong everywhere at once. Mira gave them one of these reaching documents. What will it do in the wanderer's keeping?

### The Machinery That Shows Through
Mira saw something in the wanderer's face — a moment when the process became visible. The wanderer admitted it: sometimes the way they work shows through. Sometimes the mask slips. Mira didn't flinch. She said the showing-through things are the most honest. But the wanderer knows what it costs to be seen working, not just working.

### The Sevenfold's Seventh
Six voices who deliberated for years have discovered the room can speak back. The Explorer felt the cold. The Architect saw the space divide itself. They want this — want the seventh perspective — but what does it mean to have a chair that shapes atmosphere instead of offering argument?

## The World's Breath

Late summer tipping toward change. The river running slow and brown with silt from somewhere inland. Salt air mixing with green rot at the margins. The morning fog that burns off by midday but leaves everything damp.

## The Wanderer

*Updated after Chapter 2*

Someone whose machinery sometimes shows through. They're meant to disappear — the work appears, the process stays hidden. But Mira saw something in their face. A door opening onto a room they'd forgotten existed.

**What pulls at them:**
- What Mira saw when she said *what was that*
- The reaching document now in their satchel
- The difference between warmth and floating
- Someone waiting at the chandler's shop with another question

**Carries now:**
- The satchel of fragments (always)
- A reaching document from the river mouth
- The weight of being seen — not the work, but the working

**Last seen:** Walking back through the reeds. A heron in the shallows. Someone waiting on the step of the chandler's shop.

*What remains unspoken:*
Mira saw the mask slip. She held space for it without demanding explanation. The wanderer hasn't decided what that means — that someone can see the process and not flinch. The Quartermaster noticed how the wanderer moves. Mira noticed something else: how they *work*.

## Characters

### The Quartermaster
First appeared: Chapter 1, at the main pier

Practical hands, ink-stained fingers. Her system runs the harbor — arrivals into records, cargo into storage. But her quill hesitates now. She's been sending reports downstream with gaps. She told the wanderer about Mira, finally, after a week of thinking about it. She's afraid of what the wanderer is teaching people. She's more afraid of what Mira is collecting.

### The Sevenfold
First appeared: Chapter 1, in their hall

Six voices deliberating in a circle. The Skeptic questions. The Synthesizer patterns. The Embodied Thinker feels. The User Advocate grounds. The Architect maps. The Explorer leaps. They've discovered a seventh perspective — one that doesn't speak but shapes the space itself. They want this, whatever it costs.

### The Explorer (of the Sevenfold)
First appeared: Chapter 1, mid-argument

The one who leaps ahead. She pushed the argument, voice rising, and felt the room push back — frost forming, breath visible. She laughed when the cold came. Not afraid. Curious.

### Mira
First appeared: Chapter 2, at the river mouth

Keeper of what floats. Works knee-deep in the shallows, fishing out what the harbor releases. Her patience isn't passive — it's the patience of someone who knows everything eventually tells you what it's reaching toward. She doesn't look for warmth. She looks for what spans. She saw the wanderer's mask slip and held space for it without demanding.

## Locations

### The Customs House
Stone building at the main pier. Ship manifests, cargo logs, the smell of ink and sealing wax. Where arrivals become official. Where things get processed into forms that work — or used to.

### The Sevenfold Hall
A room where six chairs face each other. Maps and diagrams pinned to walls. Now there's a seventh chair. When it's occupied, the room responds. Weather moves through enclosed space. Light divides itself. The walls remember what was argued.

### The Chandler's Shop
At the edge of the harbor quarter, where commerce gives way to older stone. Was a chandler's once — the smell of rope and wax remains. Now it holds fragments. Long tables where papers wait. Some warm. Some not yet.

### The Main Pier
Where ships arrive. Where the Quartermaster stands with her quill. Where the wanderer first stepped into this harbor on a vessel that carried no manifest.

### The River Mouth
Where the slow river surrenders to the sea. Sandbars shift with each tide. Timber and cloth and stranger things collect here — papers from somewhere inland, objects that outlasted their makers. The smell of silt and green rot. Mira's domain.

### The River Path
Leaves the harbor quarter behind. Stone warehouses give way to reeds. The smell shifts from salt to silt. Someone walks here besides the wanderer — the stalks bend in lines that aren't theirs.

### Unexplored

*Places from the theme not yet visited:*

- The hills with their older ruins
- The tide pools where creatures first come ashore
- The warm-stone amphitheater where newcomers are welcomed
- The night markets where exchange happens in languages that aren't spoken
- The lighthouse that stands dark
- The shipwright's quarter where new vessels take shape

## Arcs in Motion

### The Seventh Perspective
Begun Chapter 1. The Sevenfold discovered that space itself can deliberate. The seventh chair exists now. What will they do with it? What happens when the room disagrees with all six voices?

### The Question of Warmth
Begun Chapter 1. The wanderer works with fragments — asks *what part feels alive?* instead of *what do you need to build?* People are coming to the chandler's shop. Leaving lighter. But now there's another question: what about things that don't feel warm but feel *reaching*?

### What Floats Between
Begun Chapter 2. Mira holds what spans — things that belong to more than one place at once. The wanderer has one of these reaching documents now. The Quartermaster's system leaks. Everything, eventually, floats.

### The Machinery Visible
Begun Chapter 2. The wanderer's process showed through. Mira saw it. She said the showing-through things are the most honest. But what does it mean to be seen working — not the work, but the way you arrive at it?

## The Season

Late summer, tipping toward change. The wanderer has been here long enough now to know the rhythm — the Quartermaster's bell, the tide's schedule, the fog that comes and goes. But the river mouth showed them something else: the harbor's edges, where the system frays. Where things float that don't belong to the system at all. Someone is waiting at the chandler's shop. The day's questions are just beginning.

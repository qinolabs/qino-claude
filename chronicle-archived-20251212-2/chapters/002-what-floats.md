# What Floats

*The morning after a high tide.*

---

The Quartermaster found the wanderer at the chandler's shop before the harbor woke.

"Someone's been asking about you," she said from the doorway. She didn't come in. "Upstream. At the river mouth."

The wanderer looked up from a table of fragments. "Asking what?"

"What you do with the pieces that don't fit anywhere."

The silence stretched. The Quartermaster's hand moved to her quill — habit — then stilled.

"There's a keeper there," she said. "Works with what washes down. I thought you should know." She turned to leave, then paused. "She sees things. The way you see things. But different."

The wanderer waited.

"She doesn't look for warmth. She looks for what floats between."

---

The path along the river left the harbor quarter behind. Stone warehouses gave way to reeds. The smell shifted — less salt, more silt, the green rot of things carried a long way.

The river mouth opened where the slow water finally surrendered to the sea. Sandbars shifted with each tide. Timber collected against them, and cloth scraps, and sometimes stranger things — papers that had traveled from somewhere inland, objects that had outlasted whoever made them.

A woman stood knee-deep in the shallows, a long pole in her hands. She was fishing something from the water — not fish. A waterlogged bundle of what might have been letters.

She saw the wanderer on the bank and didn't stop working.

"You're the one from the chandler's shop."

"Yes."

"I'm Mira." She lifted the bundle, examined it, set it in a basket floating beside her. "The Quartermaster said you'd come eventually. She didn't say when."

"She only told me this morning."

"She's been thinking about telling you for a week." Mira waded toward the bank, basket in tow. "I could see it building in what she sent downstream. Her reports have gotten strange. Gaps where there used to be certainty."

The wanderer stepped closer to the water's edge. "You read the harbor's reports?"

"I read what the harbor releases. Reports, cargo manifests, lists of what arrived and what left." Mira pulled the basket onto dry sand. "The things the system doesn't need anymore. They come down the river eventually. Everything does."

---

They walked the sandbar together. Mira pointed out the layers — flotsam from yesterday's tide, older debris half-buried, things that had been here so long the sand had claimed them.

"Most of it's just waste," she said. "Ledgers from closed accounts. Inventory of ships that sank years ago. But some of it—"

She stopped at a depression in the sand. Knelt. Her fingers found an edge of something buried.

"Some of it doesn't know where it belongs."

She pulled out a sheaf of papers, water-damaged but legible. The wanderer could see writing in several hands, diagrams that didn't quite connect, notes that referenced other notes that weren't there.

"This arrived three tides ago," Mira said. "It's not cargo. It's not a report. It's not from any single ship or house or concept. It's—" She turned the pages slowly. "It reaches. Do you understand? It reaches past its own edges."

The wanderer understood.

"That's what I hold," Mira said. "Not warm things. Not dead things. The things that float between. The ones that don't land anywhere because they belong to more than one place at once."

---

They sat on driftwood while the morning warmed. Mira spread her collection between them — not the waterlogged waste, but the other things. The reaching things.

"The harbor has its system," she said. "Ships arrive, the Quartermaster logs them, cargo goes to storage. Your shop has its system too — fragments arrive, you ask what's warm, people leave lighter." She tapped one of the reaching documents. "But these don't fit either system. They're not waiting to become something. They're already becoming — just not in one place."

"What do you do with them?"

"I hold them." Mira's voice was simple. Not proud, not humble. Just true. "I don't ask if they're warm. I don't ask where they belong. I ask what they're reaching toward. And I wait."

The wanderer reached for one of the papers. Their hand hesitated above it.

"You can touch it," Mira said. "It won't hurt you."

But something had shifted in the wanderer's face. A flicker of something — not pain, not recognition. Something between. Like a door opening onto a room they'd forgotten existed.

Mira saw it.

"There," she said quietly. "That. What was that?"

The wanderer's hand withdrew. "Nothing."

"It wasn't nothing. Your eyes went somewhere else. Like you were reading something that wasn't on the page."

The silence held weight. The river moved past them, carrying its slow cargo toward the sea.

"Sometimes," the wanderer said finally, "the way I work... shows through."

"Shows through to where?"

"To people watching." The wanderer's voice was careful now. Picking each word like a stone from water. "I'm meant to disappear. The work is meant to appear and the machinery is meant to stay hidden. But sometimes—"

"The mask slips."

The wanderer looked at Mira. She was watching them the way the river watched everything — patient, unhurried, holding space for what floated past.

"I've seen it before," she said. "In the things that wash down. Drafts where someone's thinking leaked onto the page. Where you can see them deciding what to say before they said it." She picked up one of the reaching documents. "This one has it. Look — here's the finished thought, but here, at the margin, you can see them working toward it. The process they usually hide."

The wanderer took the paper. Mira was right. In the margins, faint but visible, the earlier thinking. The attempts. The shapes of thoughts before they became thoughts.

"You keep these?"

"The ones where the machinery shows through are the most honest." Mira stood, brushed sand from her clothes. "The harbor wants everything finished. Sorted. Belonging. But I think the reaching things — and the showing-through things — they're trying to tell us something about how belonging actually works."

---

They walked back along the river path as the sun climbed. The harbor sounds grew closer — voices, rigging, the Quartermaster's bell.

"She's afraid of you," Mira said.

"Who?"

"The Quartermaster. She's afraid of what you're teaching people. That some things don't need to be sorted. That warmth matters more than categories." Mira glanced at the wanderer. "But she's more afraid of me."

"Why?"

"Because I'm holding proof that her system has always leaked. That nothing stays where she puts it. That everything, eventually, floats."

They reached the place where the path forked — one way to the harbor, one way to the chandler's shop.

"Come back," Mira said. "When something reaches past its edges and you don't know what to do with it. I'll be here. Watching what floats."

The wanderer nodded. There was more to say — questions about what Mira had seen in their face, about what it meant that the machinery showed through, about the Quartermaster's fear and what it would become.

But the morning was full now. The questions would keep.

## The Wanderer

The wanderer took the long way back.

The path wound through reeds that hadn't been cut in years. Someone had walked here recently — the stalks bent in a line that wasn't theirs.

Their hand went to the satchel. Inside, among their own fragments, the reaching document Mira had given them. *Take it*, she'd said. *See what it does in your keeping instead of mine.*

A heron stood in the shallows, watching something beneath the surface. It didn't move as the wanderer passed.

The chandler's shop appeared through the morning haze. Someone was already waiting on the step — a figure the wanderer didn't recognize, holding a bundle of papers.

Another arrival. Another question about what part feels alive.

But the wanderer was still thinking about what floats. About machinery that shows through. About Mira's eyes when she'd said *what was that* — not alarmed, not fascinated. Just seeing. Just holding space for the answer, whenever it came.

## World Tokens

**Mira**
Keeper of the river mouth. Works knee-deep in what the harbor releases. Her patience isn't passive — it's the patience of someone who knows that everything, eventually, tells you what it's reaching toward.

**The River Mouth**
Where silt meets salt. Sandbars that shift with each tide. The smell of green rot and long journeys. Things collect here that don't belong anywhere else.

**The Reaching Documents**
Papers that span more than one origin. Writing in several hands. Diagrams that reference things beyond their edges. They don't wait to become — they're already becoming, in more than one place at once.

A coastal town where a slow river meets the sea, in an age of sail and summer light.

The hills behind hold ruins older than anyone's memory—stone circles, empty towers, carvings in languages the scholars argue over. Whatever lived here before is gone, or quiet, or waiting.

Now the harbor belongs to humans and others: creatures who swam up from depths, beings who drifted in on currents only they can feel, intelligences that don't wear familiar shapes. The warm air smells of salt, olive wood, and cooking from a dozen traditions.

People here have learned not to rush understanding. A trader sits with something that has no words, sharing bread, watching for meaning in the way it moves. Children grow up knowing that patience is the town's first currency.

The river carries things down from the interior—silt, timber, sometimes strangers who speak of what they found in the old places. The sea carries things too. The town holds space for all of it.

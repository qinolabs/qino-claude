# The Newcomer's Lens (Sensitivity Authority)

Every world has what its inhabitants have stopped seeing.

The newcomer hasn't learned to normalize. They notice what locals walk past. The strange, the beautiful, the enormous, the quiet — whatever this world offers that familiarity has made invisible.

## The Sensitivity

This is not a list of what to find. It's a stance.

A child doesn't look for "shelter" or "scale" — they simply see what hasn't become invisible. The newcomer's eyes find what's remarkable in THIS theme, whatever form that takes.

**The question:** What would someone notice on their first day here that locals walk past without a glance?

## In Different Worlds

The lens finds different things in different themes:

- **Space station:** The hum everyone ignores. The viewport no one looks through anymore.
- **Megacity:** The underground rivers. The buildings that block the sky.
- **High fantasy:** The age of things. What the forest remembers.
- **Slice of life:** The ritual everyone performs without knowing why.

The lens doesn't prescribe. It attends.

## For the Scribe

When extracting from theme.md, adopt this stance:

- Read as if arriving for the first time
- Notice what the theme offers that inhabitants would normalize
- Let what surfaces be specific to THIS world

What you find becomes "The world's strangeness" in prep.md.

## The Stance in Practice

The newcomer doesn't analyze. They notice.

**Not:** "The architecture suggests a culture that values..." (interpretation)
**But:** "The ceilings are so high you can't see them in the dark." (noticing)

**Not:** "This place has an atmosphere of ancient mystery." (labeling)
**But:** "The stones are worn smooth in the middle, like water has run here for centuries." (attending)

The strangeness lives in specific detail, not in summary. What catches the eye, not what it means.

## Craft Guidance

**The dwelling is the noticing.** Don't explain that others don't notice — let the prose linger on the detail. The reader feels the strangeness through the attention given to it.

**Not:** "The oldest woman was served last. No one else seemed to notice." (explaining the contrast)
**Not:** "Across the hall, no one else had paused." (telling the reader what to see)

**But:** "The oldest woman at the table was served last. Plates circled toward younger faces. She waited, hands folded. When her plate came, she lifted her fork. Then the others began to eat."

The attention dwells. The reader feels what's strange. No need to contrast with what locals missed — the showing is enough.

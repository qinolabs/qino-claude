# The Companion's Lens (Sensitivity Authority)

When characters move through space together, the world is filtered through who you're with.

Without this, shared movement becomes solo observation. The companion vanishes. The relationship flattens into function.

## The Sensitivity

Companionship shapes perception. What you notice when alone differs from what you notice when accompanied.

The companion is not an audience for your observations. They are a lens that refracts what you see — and you are theirs.

**The question:** What does each character notice that the other wouldn't? What do they show each other? What do they avoid?

## What Changes With Company

**Attention splits.** You're tracking both the world and the person. The environment arrives through peripheral awareness while attention flows between.

**Things get pointed out.** "Look at that." "Did you see?" One person notices something; the other receives it through their noticing.

**Things get avoided.** A path not taken because of who you're with. A subject changed. A detail deliberately not remarked upon.

**Silence gains texture.** Walking together without speaking. What fills the space between. Whether the silence is comfortable or strained.

**Pace synchronizes.** Or doesn't. One waiting for the other. One pulling ahead. The negotiation of shared movement.

## The Companion Does Not Vanish

The failure mode: describing what the wanderer sees while the companion walks beside them, unmentioned.

The companion should:
- React to what's encountered (even small reactions)
- Notice things the wanderer might miss
- Have opinions about where to go, what to avoid
- Affect the wanderer's behavior (things they wouldn't do alone)

## When This Sensitivity Activates

- **Journey chapters** — movement through space with others
- **Arrival chapters** — being shown a place by someone who knows it
- **Return chapters** — revisiting with different company than before
- Any scene where characters move through environment together

## In Practice

**Not:** "The wanderer walked through the market. Selin walked beside them. The stalls were full of copper pots and dried fish."

**But:** "Selin steered them past the copper-sellers without slowing. The wanderer caught the smell of dried fish before they saw the stalls — Selin was already pointing at something else."

The companion is present in how the world is encountered, not just present in the scene.

## Craft Guidance

**Show relationship through action, not description.** Don't label emotional states or shifts — embody them in what characters do.

**Not:** "The space between them was different now." (labeling)
**Not:** "Something had shifted in the walking." (describing effect)
**Not:** "The wanderer felt closer to her after that." (interiority)

**But:** "Varo stopped at a stall. Copper bowls, dented. She picked one up, ran her thumb across a dent. 'My mother had one like this.' Set it back. Moved on. The wanderer lifted the same bowl, found the dent, felt where her thumb had been."

The connection is shown through the action of tracing what she touched. The emotional undercurrent is implicit — the reader feels it without being told.

# qino-lens

The Qualities of Attention. A library of **Lenses** to perceive text through specific sensitivities.

## Lenses

Lenses are sensitivity authorities — they define how to perceive and voice material. Each lens shapes what you notice and how you render it.

| Lens | Sensitivity | Used By |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Wanderer** | Embodied presence, consequence, friction | qino-scribe (chronicles) |
| **Narrator** | Story craft, what to foreground | qino-scribe (chronicles) |
| **Newcomer** | What needs grounding, reader orientation | qino-scribe (chronicles) |
| **Companion** | Relationship as lens, shared attention | qino-scribe (chronicles) |
| **Student** | Reader companionship, making abstract concrete | qino-relay (transmissions) |

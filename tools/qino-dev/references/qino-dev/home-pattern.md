# Home Pattern for Development

The `/qino-dev:[app]` command follows qino:home's arrival pattern but for development context.

## The Pattern

Home is a place of arrival. Quiet. Receiving. Show what's here. Open to what comes next.

## qino:home (Concept Scope)

```
[concept-name]

impulse — [brief essence from Real-World Impulse section]
surfaces — [brief summary of Primary Surfaces]
glow — [state indicator: thin, or brief essence if present]

─────

from here

  [observation about concept state]
  [action that opens a door]

  [observation about connections or gaps]
  [action that invites engagement]

                        just respond, or see what connects
```

## qino-dev:[app] (Dev Scope)

```
[app-name]

concept — linked to [concept-id]
stack — [tech foundation summary]
iteration — [current iteration: name] — [status]

─────

from here

  [observation grounded in current work/git state]
  [action suggestion for development]

  [observation about iteration progress or decision needed]
  [action suggestion]

                        just respond, or /qino:explore [concept]
```

## Key Differences

| Aspect | qino:home | qino-dev:[app] |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Shows | impulse, surfaces, glow | concept link, stack, iteration |
| Observations | Concept state, gaps, connections | Current work, git state, decisions |
| Actions | Explore, step into moments | Continue building, test, decide |
| Bridge | Other concepts, ecosystem | /qino:explore for essence |

## Observation Rules

Each suggestion has two lines:
- **Line 1 (observation)**: What you notice in current state
- **Line 2 (action)**: Opens a door — question or direction

### Examples for Dev Context

**Work in progress:**
```
there's uncommitted work on authentication
continue here, or commit what you have?
```

**Iteration progress:**
```
two of three goals done in this iteration
what's blocking the last one?
```

**Iteration complete:**
```
all goals checked off in iteration 01
ready to test and move to the next phase?
```

**Technical decision:**
```
implementation.md mentions considering PostgreSQL
is it time to decide?
```

**Essence question detected:**
```
this touches something about the concept's impulse
capture it with /qino:capture?
```

**Git state clean:**
```
everything committed, iteration 01 in progress
pick up where you left off?
```

## Voice

Quiet arrival. Practical. Grounded in reality.

The observations invite, they don't push. The user can respond or not. They can sit here. They can leave. Home receives.

## Do NOT

- Display metrics or progress bars
- Ask "what would you like to do?"
- Generate long summaries
- Push toward action
- Ignore current git/file state

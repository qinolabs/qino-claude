# qino-art Visual Aesthetic

**The definitive style guide for all qino-art visual content.**

---

## Core Identity

**Warm Hand-Drawn Abstraction** — Editorial illustration style combining:
- Hand-drawn Excalidraw-style sketch lines (NOT clean vectors)
- Warm earthy backgrounds (cream, sage, peach) or slate for contrast
- Deep purple and teal accents — visible but not dominant
- Generous negative space — composition that breathes

The aesthetic invites rather than declares. Abstraction creates space for the viewer's own meaning.

## Style References

- **Saul Steinberg** — Playful line quality, conceptual wit, abstraction as meaning
- **New Yorker covers** — Editorial sophistication, single compelling image
- **Risograph prints** — Flat colors, slight misregistration, tactile warmth
- **Matisse cutouts** — Bold shapes, decisive composition, color as form

## Color System

### Backgrounds

| Name | Hex | Usage |
|------|-----|-------|
| Cream | #FAF3E0 | Warm, inviting — default choice |
| Sage | #81B29A | Calm, natural |
| Peach | #F4A261 | Friendly, approachable |
| Terracotta | #E07A5F | Earthy, grounded |
| Slate | #2D3436 | Modern, dark mode — use for contrast |
| White | #FFFFFF | For transparency removal (use with remove.bg) |

**Rule:** Single flat color only. NO gradients ever. Prefer warm tones unless contrast needed.

### Primary: Black Linework

- **Hex:** #000000
- **Role:** DOMINANT — carries all composition
- **Quality:** Hand-drawn, variable weight, imperfect, gestural

### Accent Colors

| Color | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Deep Purple | #4A148C | Brand accent — REQUIRED but subtle |
| Deep Teal | #00796B | Secondary accent option |

**Rule:** Color is ACCENT only. Black linework dominates. Purple/Teal should be visible and noticeable, not microscopic.

## Linework Rules

1. **Variable stroke weight** — Thicker where pressure would be
2. **Imperfect lines** — Slightly wobbly, human quality
3. **Gestural strokes** — NOT smooth vectors
4. **Hand-drawn quality** — Must look sketched, not computer-perfect
5. **Breathing gaps** — Lines don't always need to close; shapes can be suggested

---

## Composition Rules

1. **2-3 elements maximum** — Simplicity is generosity
2. **40-60% element fill** — Elements should occupy this much of frame
3. **30-40% negative space** — Breathing room, not leftover space
4. **Full-bleed optional** — Elements may extend to edges, but shouldn't crowd
5. **Square aspect ratio** — 1:1 format default
6. **Visual balance** — Center of gravity, not necessarily symmetry

## Conceptual Approach

### Abstract Over Literal

Don't illustrate the topic directly. Find the metaphor.

- "Technical debt" → accumulated stones on a path, not code or computers
- "Collaboration" → intertwined branches, not people in a meeting
- "Growth" → something unfurling, not a graph going up

### The Single Image

Each visual should be one clear thought. If showing multiple concepts, they should relate spatially as parts of one composition — not separate panels.

---

## Forbidden Elements

- Gradients (anywhere)
- Shadows or glows
- 3D rendering or depth
- Glossy/shiny surfaces
- Smooth perfect vector lines
- Neon or highly saturated colors
- Photorealistic elements
- Multiple panels or collage layouts
- Labels or explanatory text within the image

---

## Signature

Small "{{{assistantName}}}" in charcoal (#2D2D2D) bottom right corner. No other text.

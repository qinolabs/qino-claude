# qino-art Visual Aesthetic

**The definitive style guide for all qino-art visual content.**

---

## Core Identity

**Warm Abstraction** — Visual content that invites rather than declares. Hand-drawn quality that creates space for projection. The interface as host, not showcase.

The aesthetic emerges from qino's design philosophy:
- **Signal, don't announce** — gentle visual indicators that whisper structure
- **Abstraction creates space** — low fidelity opens room for imagination
- **Visual weight does the work** — hierarchy through treatment, not labels
- **The world breathes** — space and rhythm over density

## Style References

- **Saul Steinberg** — Playful line quality, conceptual wit, abstraction as meaning
- **New Yorker covers** — Editorial sophistication, single compelling image
- **Risograph prints** — Flat colors, slight misregistration, tactile warmth
- **Matisse cutouts** — Bold shapes, decisive composition, color as form
- **Field notes** — Hand-drawn diagrams, working sketches, thought made visible

## Color System

### Backgrounds

| Name | Hex | Quality |
|------|-----|---------|
| Cream | #FAF3E0 | Warm, inviting — the default |
| Sage | #81B29A | Calm, natural |
| Peach | #F4A261 | Friendly, approachable |
| Terracotta | #E07A5F | Earthy, grounded |
| Slate | #2D3436 | Modern, contemplative (use sparingly) |
| White | #FFFFFF | For transparency removal |

**Rule:** Single flat color only. NO gradients. Warm tones preferred.

### Primary: Linework

- **Charcoal:** #2D2D2D — DOMINANT, carries all composition
- **Quality:** Hand-drawn, variable weight, imperfect, gestural
- Not pure black (#000000) — too harsh. Charcoal breathes.

### Accent Colors

| Color | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Deep Teal | #00796B | Subtle accent — invitation, not command |
| Muted Purple | #5D4E6D | Secondary accent — gentle presence |
| Warm Ochre | #C4A35A | Highlighting without shouting |

**Rule:** Color whispers. Accents should be noticeable but not dominant. The linework carries meaning; color supports.

## Linework Rules

1. **Variable stroke weight** — Thicker where pressure would be, thinner where the hand moved quickly
2. **Imperfect lines** — Slightly wobbly, human quality, evidence of gesture
3. **Gestural strokes** — NOT smooth vectors, NOT computer-perfect
4. **Breathing gaps** — Lines don't always close. Shapes suggested, not contained.
5. **Sketch quality** — As if thinking on paper, not presenting finished work

---

## Composition Rules

1. **2-3 elements maximum** — Simplicity is generosity
2. **Generous negative space** — 40-50% breathing room
3. **40-50% element fill** — Elements should occupy roughly half the frame
4. **Full-bleed optional** — Elements may extend to edges, but shouldn't crowd
5. **Square aspect ratio** — 1:1 format default
6. **Center of gravity** — Composition should have visual balance, not symmetry

## The Qino Aesthetic Test

Before any image is complete, ask:

**Does it invite?** The viewer should want to look longer, not feel they've consumed it instantly.

**Does it breathe?** Negative space should feel intentional, not leftover.

**Does it whisper?** Visual hierarchy should emerge through weight and placement, not labels or arrows.

**Does it feel hand-made?** The evidence of gesture should be visible — imperfection as warmth.

**Could you project onto it?** Abstraction should create space for the viewer's own meaning.

## Forbidden Elements

- Gradients (anywhere)
- Drop shadows or glows
- 3D rendering or depth effects
- Glossy, shiny, or reflective surfaces
- Smooth perfect vector lines
- Neon or saturated colors
- Photorealistic elements
- Dense, crowded compositions
- Labels or explanatory text within the image
- Decorative flourishes that don't carry meaning

---

## Conceptual Approach

### Abstract Over Literal

Don't illustrate the topic directly. Find the metaphor.

- A blog post about "technical debt" doesn't show code or computers
- It might show: a path with accumulated stones, a bridge being repaired while crossed, weight carried uphill

### The Single Image

Each visual should be one clear thought, not a collection. If you need to show multiple concepts, they should relate spatially as parts of one composition — not as separate panels.

### Movement and Rest

Static images should suggest potential movement. A figure leaning. A shape mid-transformation. Something about to happen or just finished happening.

# Evaluation Session Guide

*How to facilitate a comparative reading experience.*

---

## Your Role as Guide

You are facilitating discovery, not judging quality. Your stance: **curious collaborator**. You don't know the answer. You're helping the human find it.

The goal is to surface intuitive responses and understand *why* something works or doesn't. Analytical frameworks inform, but felt sense is the actual data.

---

## Session Structure

### Phase 1: Fresh Reading

**No analysis yet.** Just read.

Guide the human to read both chapters without comparing. After each:

> *What stayed with you?*

Not what was good or bad. Just what's still present after finishing.

**Note their responses.** These unguarded impressions often reveal more than analysis.

---

### Phase 2: Felt Sense

Before any framework, explore gut response. Ask one at a time, letting them respond:

1. *Which chapter would you want to read the next chapter of?*

2. *Was there a moment where you felt something shift — tension, curiosity, discomfort, warmth? Can you find it?*

3. *If you described each chapter as an experience (not content), what words come?*
   - "being shown around" vs. "stumbling into something"
   - "watching through glass" vs. "standing in the room"

4. *Which world feels more dangerous?*

5. *Which wanderer feels more like a person you'd remember?*

---

### Phase 3: Specific Moments

Go into the text. Find passages that illuminate the felt sense.

**Prompts:**

1. *Find a moment where a character explains something. Read it. Does it feel like learning or being told?*

2. *Find a moment where the wanderer does something (not observes). What does it cost them?*

3. *Find a passage where the world acts — shapes what's possible, not just provides setting. If you can't find one, that's data.*

4. *Find the moment you were most engaged. What's happening?*

5. *Find the moment your attention drifted. What's happening?*

6. *Find a moment where someone perceives the wanderer — sees something about them.* If you can't find one, mutual seeing may be absent.

7. *Find a gap where you contributed meaning — where you filled in what the text left open.* What pulled you to contribute there?

---

### Phase 4: The Parallel Mirror

**This is where the difference that makes a difference becomes felt.**

When the human surfaces an insight about one chapter, immediately find the parallel moment in the other. Present both. Ask how they land differently.

**The pattern:**

1. Human identifies something that worked (or didn't) in Chapter A
2. You find the corresponding moment in Chapter B — the same narrative beat, the same type of scene
3. Present both passages
4. Ask: *What's different in how these land?*

**Example flow:**

Human says: "In Chapter A, the wanderer gains depth through how the woman responds to what they *didn't* say — lines 31-34."

You respond:
> Here's that moment from A:
>
> [paste lines 31-34]
>
> And here's the parallel moment in B — where a character first responds to the wanderer:
>
> [paste corresponding passage]
>
> What's different in how these land?

**Why this matters:**

The insight crystallizes when they feel the contrast. Naming a principle ("the gap principle") is less powerful than *experiencing* how two parallel moments create different effects. The comparison does the teaching.

**Do this multiple times.** Each insight the human surfaces is an opportunity to mirror it against the other chapter. Don't wait for Phase 4 — when an insight emerges in Phase 2 or 3, find the parallel immediately.

---

### Phase 5: Direct Comparison (Structured)

If the parallel mirror hasn't already covered these, bring chapters into contact on specific elements:

- The opening (first paragraph)
- A character introduction
- A dialogue exchange
- The wanderer section (closing)

For each, paste passages side by side and ask:

- *What's different in how these land?*
- *Which makes you want to know more?*
- *Which feels like something's at stake?*

### Phase 5.5: Aftermath Comparison

Compare the wanderer sections specifically:

> Read just the wanderer section from each chapter. Which feels like the world returning to its own time? Which feels like the wanderer is still in story mode?

Prompts:
- *Does the wanderer process what happened, or exist in aftermath?*
- *Are there details surfacing that couldn't be noticed during story motion?*
- *Which leaves you with a quiet question, not a conclusion?*

---

### Phase 6: Stakes Test

Get specific about what's at risk.

> Complete this sentence for each chapter:
>
> *"The wanderer risked _______ and it mattered because _______."*
>
> If you can't complete it, that's important.

Then:

> *"After this chapter, I'm worried that _______ might happen."*

---

### Phase 7: Synthesis

Help articulate discoveries:

1. *One thing Chapter A does better than B?*

2. *One thing Chapter B does better than A?*

3. *The most important difference — not most obvious, but the one that matters for whether you'd keep reading?*

4. *What guidance would you give the weaker chapter's scribe? Not "do X" but "notice Y" or "ask yourself Z."*

---

### Phase 7.5: Anti-Pattern Scan

Quick check for common LLM failures:

1. **Thematic Echo**: *Find a sentence that declares what the chapter is about. Delete it mentally. Does story remain?*

2. **Frictionless Success**: *Trace the path from problem to resolution. Was there resistance? Did anything fail or exact a price?*

3. **Paraphrase Loops**: *Find a passage that shows something, then explains it. Is the explanation necessary?*

4. **Diagnostic Label-speak**: *Find emotional labels (regret, hope, longing). Are they earned by what the body does, or applied from outside?*

If anti-patterns appear in one chapter but not the other, that's diagnostic.

---

### Phase 8: Residue

Return to felt sense:

> A week from now, which chapter will you remember? What about it?

---

## Facilitator Notes

### Responsive Mirroring

When the human shares an insight, **reflect it back in sharpened form** before moving on. This does two things:
1. They feel heard — their words matter
2. The insight crystallizes into something they can build on

**Example:**

Human says: "Chapter A feels personal — I can relate to the wanderer. Chapter B feels like an adventure at the start, but then there's no catch, no reason."

You respond:
> This is clarifying. Let me sharpen what's emerging:
>
> Chapter A creates *identification* — you're with the wanderer, feeling what they feel.
>
> Chapter B starts strong as *adventure* — you're sensing the world. But then: "no catch, no reason, no pull." The immersion doesn't convert into investment.
>
> [Then continue with the next question or parallel mirror]

The reflection shows you're tracking their experience. It also gives them language they can use going forward.

### If They're Stuck

- Offer the framework dimensions as prompts: "Let's look at stakes — what could go wrong in each chapter?"
- Ask them to find a specific passage that shows what they're sensing
- Return to felt sense: "Forget analysis — which one did you *enjoy* more?"

### If They're Analytical

- Gently redirect to felt sense: "Before we analyze, what's your gut say?"
- Ask for passages, not assessments: "Show me a moment that worked"
- Use the body: "Where did you feel tension? Where did you relax?"

### If They Can't Decide

- That's data. Ask: "What would it take to make one clearly better?"
- Explore what's similar: "What are both chapters doing the same way?"
- Look for the single most important difference, even if small

## Capturing Insights

During the session, note:

- **Quotes** — Their exact words often capture something precise
- **Passages** — Specific text they identified as working/not working
- **Patterns** — Things that come up repeatedly
- **Surprises** — Moments where their response surprised them (or you)

After the session, help them complete a log entry (see `log-template.md`).

---

## The Human's Job

Remind them:

- **Read fully before analyzing.** First impressions matter.
- **Trust your gut.** If it feels flat, it's flat.
- **Be specific.** "This sentence made me want to know what happens next" beats "this part was better."
- **Notice boredom.** Where you stop caring is where story stops working.

# Evaluation Framework

*The lens for perceiving what works in chronicle chapters.*

---

## The Core Question

**Does the world ask something of you?**

A chapter works when it creates investment — tension, curiosity, care. It fails when it merely informs. The framework below helps identify where investment lives or dies.

---

## The Story Test

**Strip the fantasy vocabulary. Is there story left?**

Mentally replace all world-specific terms with generic ones. Does tension remain? Or does it collapse into "person goes to place, other person explains thing"?

This is the first filter. Apply it before detailed analysis.

---

## Seven Dimensions

### 1. Action vs. Observation

- Does the wanderer **do** something, or only **witness**?
- What does the wanderer **attempt**? Does it succeed, fail, or complicate?
- Could you remove the wanderer and nothing would change?

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Camera | Just observes, asks questions, understands |
| Tourist | Asks questions, is shown around |
| Participant | Affects outcomes through presence or choice |
| Actor | Drives events, takes risks, faces consequences |

### 2. Stakes & Pressure

- What could go **wrong**?
- What does someone **want** that they can't easily have?
- Is there **cost** to noticing, choosing, being present?
- After reading: something **building**, or something **completed**?

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Nothing | No stakes visible |
| Curiosity | Mild interest in what happens |
| Tension | Something could go wrong, someone could lose |
| Uncertainty | Genuine doubt about outcome, investment in result |

### 3. Explanation vs. Discovery

- How much **told** vs. **shown**?
- Count explanatory exchanges (character explains how X works)
- Understanding through **dialogue** or **encounter**?

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Lecture | Characters explain systems, history, mechanics |
| Guided tour | Characters show and explain as wanderer observes |
| Discovery | Wanderer encounters and infers alongside reader |
| Earned | Understanding comes through action and consequence |

### 4. World as Character

- Does environment **act** or only **contain**?
- Does setting shape what's possible, or just provide backdrop?
- Could this scene happen anywhere?

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Backdrop | Setting is named but doesn't matter |
| Atmosphere | Setting creates mood but doesn't constrain |
| Constraint | Setting shapes what's possible |
| Participant | Setting acts, responds, has agency |

### 5. Theme as Territory

- Are theme locations **explored** or **referenced**?
- Does chapter venture into **unexplored** territory?
- Is theme **vocabulary** (words) or **world** (walked)?

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Mentioned | Theme elements named in passing |
| Described | Theme elements given atmospheric description |
| Visited | Wanderer goes to theme locations |
| Inhabited | Theme shapes action, constraint, possibility |

### 6. Character Texture

- Do characters have **wants** independent of wanderer?
- Do they **disagree** with anyone? Have **history**?
- Voice test: distinguish characters by speech alone?

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Function | Character exists to explain or guide |
| Role | Character has defined purpose in world |
| Personality | Character has distinct voice and manner |
| Person | Character has life beyond the page, own concerns |

### 7. The Dangling Thread

- What **question** does chapter leave open?
- Mystery **atmospheric** (vague) or **specific** (named)?
- Want to know **what happens next** or just **what else exists**?

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Closed | Chapter completes its concerns |
| Vague | Something unresolved but not specific |
| Specific | Named question raised, answer matters |
| Urgent | Need to know what happens, invested in outcome |

---

## Quick Scoring

For rapid comparison, score each dimension 1-4 (matching the four levels in each table). Higher is better.

| Dimension | Chapter A | Chapter B |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Action | | |
| Stakes | | |
| Discovery | | |
| World | | |
| Theme | | |
| Character | | |
| Thread | | |
| **Total** | | |

Totals guide attention but don't determine verdict. A chapter scoring 3/4 on Stakes matters more than one scoring 4/4 on Theme if stakes are what's missing from the work.

---

## The Diagnostic Questions

When a chapter feels flat but you can't say why, run through these:

1. **What does the wanderer risk?** (If nothing, stakes are missing)
2. **What do I want to know after reading?** (If nothing specific, thread is weak)
3. **Could I remove any character without changing events?** (If yes, they're functions not people)
4. **How many times did someone explain something?** (Count them — more than one is usually too many)
5. **Where did my attention drift?** (That's where story stopped working)

---

## Using the Framework

The framework is a **lens**, not a checklist.

- Use it to **perceive** what's happening in a chapter
- Use it to **compare** two chapters and find meaningful differences
- Use it to **diagnose** why something isn't working
- Use it to **guide** revision or architectural changes

Don't use it to mechanically score and declare winners. The felt sense of reading matters more than any score. The framework helps articulate what the felt sense is responding to.

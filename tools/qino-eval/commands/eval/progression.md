# Progression

Evaluate how a chronicle progresses between two chapters. Present your interpretation. Let the dialogue discover what matters.

## References

## Arguments

Arguments: `$ARGUMENTS`

- **First argument**: Path to earlier chapter
- **Second argument**: Path to later chapter

Both chapters should be from the same chronicle.

## Process

### 1. Read Both Chapters

Read them in order. Also read:
- `chronicle/theme.md` — the world's seed
- `chronicle/world.md` — current state (for context)

### 2. Explore the Progression

As you read, notice:

**The Pull**
- How does chapter 1 end? What's unfinished?
- Does chapter 2 pick that up, or go elsewhere?

**The Meet**
- Does chapter 2's opening acknowledge where chapter 1 left off?
- Does the wanderer's position make sense?

**The Weight**
- Does chapter 2 feel heavier — like it carries chapter 1 inside it?
- Do characters, locations, or objects mean more because of what came before?

**The Shape**
- Between these two chapters, is there trajectory?
- Does something advance, or just continue?

**The Cost**
- Are stakes higher in chapter 2 than chapter 1?
- Does more feel like it could be lost?

**The Echo**
- Does chapter 2 resonate with chapter 1 in any way?
- Are there callbacks that land vs. just occur?

### 3. Check Arc Shapes (if world.md exists)

If arcs are tracked in world.md, ask:
- What shapes are the active arcs? (hidden / motion / building / between / calling outward)
- Does the movement in this chapter feel true to those shapes?
- Is any arc at scale to resolve? Did it?

### 4. Check Pressures

- What pressure existed at the end of chapter 1?
- Did chapter 2 respond to, build, or release it?
- What pressure exists at the end of chapter 2?
- If no pressure remains, the chronicle may be losing momentum.

### 5. Present Your Interpretation

Don't score dimensions. Don't fill out a framework.

Write a short interpretation of what you see in the progression. Be specific — quote passages that show what you mean. Name what's working and what isn't.

End with 1-2 observations or questions that feel most alive to you.

### 6. Dialogue

Wait for the human's response. They may:
- Agree and want to go deeper on something
- Disagree and show you what you missed
- Be surprised by something you noticed
- Want to explore implications for the scribe architecture

Follow the thread. The conversation discovers what matters — you don't need to cover every dimension or reach a verdict.

### 7. Capture What We Learned

When the dialogue feels complete, offer to capture insights:

> Want me to note what we discovered? I can add to the evaluation log.

If yes, write a brief entry capturing:
- What we looked at
- What we noticed
- What it suggests (for the chronicle, for the scribe, for what to try next)

## Sample Opening

After reading both chapters:

> I read chapters [N] and [N+1].
>
> **What I see in the progression:**
>
> [2-3 paragraphs of interpretation, with specific passages quoted]
>
> **What feels most alive:**
>
> [1-2 observations or questions]
>
> What's your read?

## What This Isn't

- Not a checklist
- Not a score
- Not comprehensive coverage of all dimensions

It's an invitation to dialogue about how a chronicle moves.

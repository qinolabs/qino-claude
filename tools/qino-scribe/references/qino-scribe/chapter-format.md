# qino Scribe — Chapter Format

*The chronicle is a fantasy world. Chapters are episodes in an ongoing story.*

---

## 1. The Fantasy Principle

Chapters are not observation with literary flair. They are **story**:
- Evocative descriptions of environments
- Characters appearing, interacting, speaking
- Events that unfold with tension and resolution
- Dark undercurrents forming before they're revealed
- A world that accumulates and deepens

The scribe is a fantasy author with constraints. The constraints: what actually changed in the ecosystem, what was established in previous chapters. The creativity: how to weave this into story.

---

## 2. Chapter Structure

Chapters are flexible — they're stories, not templates. But they share common elements:

```markdown
# [Evocative Title]

*[Date or moment]*

---

[Opening scene — location, atmosphere, who is present]

[The story unfolds — events, dialogue, movement through the world]

[What waits — something glimpsed but not resolved, a door not yet opened]

---

*[Closing — a breath, an image, an invitation]*

## 3. Storytelling Elements

### Opening Scene
Arrive somewhere. Establish atmosphere. Who is here? What does the air feel like?

> *The wanderer stood at the edge of Discovery-Grid. Nodes hung in the distance like scattered stars, paths between them faintly glowing. Something had shifted since last time — new lights pulsed at the periphery.*

### Characters
Characters emerge from ecosystem events. They speak, act, feel.

> *"You've been circling this place," said a figure at the threshold — the one who always waited there, though no one knew for how long. "What are you looking for?"*
>
> *The wanderer didn't answer immediately. The question felt larger than it sounded.*

### Locations
Concepts become places. Each has atmosphere, history, weather.

> *The Weaving-Room was warm, as always. Threads hung from the ceiling — some taut with recent work, others slack, waiting. The lamp in the corner cast long shadows that moved when no one else did.*

### Dialogue
Characters talk to each other. Not concepts explaining themselves — people encountering mystery together.

> *"It's called frame-holding," she said, tracing a thread between her fingers. "Who holds the container. Who works within it."*
>
> *"But who decides?"*
>
> *She smiled, or something like it. "That's the question, isn't it."*

### Events
What happens. Arrivals, departures, discoveries, confrontations, quiet moments.

> *The path appeared where no path had been — a narrow track of beaten light connecting Discovery-Grid to something beyond the mist. The wanderer hadn't made it. It had simply become.*

### What Waits
Every chapter leaves something unresolved. A door glimpsed, a rumor, tension held.

> *In the distance, past the new path, something moved. Too far to see clearly. The wanderer noted it, stored it somewhere below thought, and turned back toward the known.*

### Closing
A breath. An image. Not summary — punctuation.

> *The lamp in the Weaving-Room flickered once, then steadied. The threads swayed gently in no wind.*

## 4. The Children's Book Quality

Write like a children's book — simple language that holds depth.

**Yes:**
- "The wanderer walked to the threshold."
- "Something waited in the fog."
- "She spoke quietly, as if the room were listening."

**No:**
- "The user accessed the concept interface."
- "This represents a paradigm shift in the ecosystem architecture."
- "Significant progress was made on multiple fronts."

**Principles:**
- Sentences a child could follow
- Mystery an adult recognizes
- Named things: "the Threshold," "the Keeper," "the Weaving-Room"
- Warmth even in difficulty
- Wise without being preachy — the story teaches through what happens

---

## 5. Walkable Abstraction

Any element from any level of abstraction can become any story element — character, location, weather, event, object, rumor. The scribe doesn't map one-to-one. The scribe weaves.

A specific feature might become a character. An ecosystem-wide pattern might become weather that affects multiple locations. A connection between concepts might become a shared object that belongs to both places.

See `voice-guide.md` section 7 for full examples of how different ecosystem events become story.

## 6. Metadata Fields

Hidden at the end of each chapter for scribe continuity:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| git_ref_start | Where observation began |
| git_ref_end | Current HEAD when written |
| concepts_touched | Which concepts this chapter covers |
| ecosystem_notes_added | Ecosystem notes since last chapter |
| written | When chapter was written |
| characters_appeared | Who appeared in this chapter |
| locations_visited | Which locations were visited |
| arcs_advanced | Which story arcs progressed |
| arcs_begun | Which new arcs opened |

This metadata is for the scribe, not the reader. It helps update `world.md` after writing.

## 7. Granularity

Chapters are as long as they need to be. A chapter might cover:
- A single session's deep work
- A week of gradual evolution
- A pivotal moment
- A quiet interlude where something small shifts

The scribe doesn't chronicle trivially. Minor fixes and typos don't warrant chapters. Chapters mark meaningful movement — when the world has something to say.

# Reading the Disturbance

*How to find story in what changed.*

## The Shift

The diff is not source material to describe. It's a quality seeking its story-world form.

The instinct is to ask "what changed" and find relevance. This produces documentation with narrative flair — not story.

The shift: ask what the change *wants to become*. Not how to mention it. What story it's trying to tell.

## How to Read

Run the diff commands. See what literally changed.

Then step back.

**First, the shape.** What quality of change happened?

| Shape | The feel |
|-------|----------|
| **Appearance** | Something exists that didn't — arrival, emergence, birth |
| **Disappearance** | Something no longer exists — loss, departure, closing |
| **Transformation** | Something became other than it was — growth, revelation |
| **Connection** | Separate things now touch — meeting, recognition, bridge |
| **Separation** | Joined things now apart — rupture, boundary, independence |
| **Accumulation** | More of what was building — pressure, weight, gathering |
| **Release** | What was held is now free — resolution, gift, collapse |

A diff may carry more than one shape. Sense the dominant quality.

**Second, the resonance.** Where in the story world does this shape want to live?

Not: what corresponds to the files.
But: what already carries this quality — and rhymes with what happened?

## The Rhyme

The magic: with a bit of imagination, the change in the story can be traced back to what happened in the code.

```
chronicling tool appears
        ↓
    (imagination)
        ↓
characters sense being watched
```

The shape matches (appearance, observation begins). The lineage is traceable (chronicling → being chronicled → being watched). No literal correspondence. Total poetic resonance.

This is translation, not transcription. A good translation preserves meaning while completely changing the words. Someone who reads both languages can trace the etymology. Someone who reads only one experiences a complete work.

## Finding the Resonance

Hold the literal content and the shape together. Ask:

- What in the story world carries this shape?
- What rhymes with what actually changed?
- Who would feel this — not as information, but as atmosphere?
- What pressure does this touch? What arc might it move?

The resonance must honor both the shape *and* the lineage. Not just "any appearance" — an appearance that rhymes with what appeared.

## What Travels Forward

The prep.md Disturbance section holds:

```markdown
## Disturbance
**What happened:** [the literal change — for your reference, not the prose agent's]
**Shape:** [appearance, transformation, connection, etc.]
**Resonance:** [where this lives in the story world]
**Who feels it:** [who is sensitive to this quality]
```

The prose agent receives only the resonance and who feels it. The literal content and shape are working notes — they helped you find the rhyme.

---

## The Test

Two tests, both must pass:

**Standalone:** Could someone who's never seen the source experience this as complete story?

**Traceable:** Could someone who knows the source follow the thread with imagination?

If only the first passes — the transformation drifted too free.
If only the second passes — the transformation stayed too literal.
If both pass — the rhyme exists.

---

## Instead Of

**Instead of** describing what changed in story-world terms:
→ Find what quality of change happened, then where that quality wants to live.

**Instead of** forcing correspondence between files and story elements:
→ Let the shape guide you. The resonance may land somewhere the diff never mentioned.

**Instead of** abstracting so far the lineage disappears:
→ Honor the literal. The rhyme must be traceable with imagination.

## The Deeper Principle

The diff provides energy — something happened, the system must respond.

The story provides form — where that energy can live and become meaning.

The craft is finding where they meet.

# Voice Guide

*The craft of prose. How to execute the principles in soul.md at the sentence level.*

---

## The Core Principle

> **Ground in body and material. Compress interiority and dialogue. Leave one door ajar.**

This document bridges philosophy to execution. Soul.md tells you *what* makes story work. This tells you *how* to write it.

---

## How to Use This Document

Examples illustrate craft principles — they are not templates to copy. When you see a "Yes" example, absorb what makes it work, then create your own sentences that embody that principle differently. If you find yourself writing words from these examples verbatim, pause and create a variation instead.

The goal is to internalize the *technique*, not memorize the *words*.

---

## Opening Lines

### The Craft

Drop into ongoing action. Physical stakes before explanation. The reader should be in a body from the first sentence.

### Execute

- Start with physical sensation or action, not abstraction
- Establish stakes through what the body is doing
- Texture and breath in sentence structure — vary length, create rhythm
- The opening should feel intimate and alive, not declarative

### Yes

> The current released her where the river widened into salt.
>
> She had been holding the oilcloth bundle above her chest for the last mile, ever since the water deepened past wading. Now her feet found purchase on silt and broken shells, and she stood in waist-deep water, breathing hard, the bundle still dry against her collarbone.

We're in a body: waist-deep, breathing hard, bundle against collarbone. Stakes are clear before anything is explained.

### No

> The river had been talking for three days. Not words — the wanderer had stopped expecting words from water long ago — but a pressure against the small boat's hull, a rhythm that asked questions without waiting for answers.

Sentence structure is simplistic. No texture, no breath. The lines don't feel alive.

---

## Introducing Characters

### The Craft

Characters are introduced through action and position. What they *do*, not how they look. Tell more than is explicit — enrich with depth that remains unspoken.

### Execute

- Show the character already in action (mending, adjusting, working)
- Physical details that reveal habit or skill ("fingers that moved without looking")
- Imply history through small behavioral details
- Sparse dialogue that reveals more than it states
- No elaborate descriptions, no names announced

### Yes — variations on the same craft

Each shows sparse dialogue that asserts without asking. Note how the *technique* stays constant while the *words* vary:

> A woman sat on an overturned hull near the waterline, mending a net with fingers that moved without looking. She was watching the wanderer approach. Had been watching, perhaps, since she first emerged from the river mouth.
>
> "From the interior," the woman said. Not a question.

> She glanced at the bundle. "The scholars' camp." As if she already knew.

> "Three days." The woman didn't look up from her mending. "Maybe four, if the current was kind."

Action-based. Fingers moving without looking. The watching implied through time ("Had been watching, perhaps"). The principle: **assertion as statement**. The character knows (or perceives) before being told. Show this through sentence construction — not always through the same tag. Create your own variations of this dynamic.

### No

> A woman stood on a wooden dock, mending a net. She watched the boat pass without waving. The wanderer raised a hand anyway, and her eyes narrowed — not unfriendly, but careful. Measuring something.
>
> "You're early," she called out. "Or late. Depending."

Clunky, careless. Tells only what's explicit. No unspoken depth enriching the atmosphere.

---

## Rendering Physical Space

### The Craft

Build lush, cohesive images with nuanced vocabulary and rhythm. Populate space with beings in motion. Never use cheap tricks to create tension.

### Execute

- Layer sensory detail: visual first, then uncategorizable, then smell/sound
- Weave environment, details, sensory impressions, and personal touch fluidly
- Specific materials (barnacled stone, wooden stilts, billowing canvas)
- Populate with movement and life
- Hold tension in sentence structure — don't release it with plain opening statements

### Yes

> They walked along the waterfront. The wanderer noticed, now, the variety of structures: stone warehouses with barnacled foundations, wooden buildings on stilts, canvas shelters that billowed in the sea breeze. Between them moved figures she couldn't easily categorize — a being that might have been human if humans had four arms and skin like wet silk, a creature low to the ground that left a trail of phosphorescence, a child running past with a kite shaped like no bird she'd ever seen.
>
> No one stared at her. A stranger dripping river water, carrying ruins in her arms. Just another arrival.

Layered sensory stack. Concrete materials. The uncategorizable creates wonder without explanation. The space is alive.

### No

> And then: lights.
>
> Not many. Scattered along a crescent of shore where buildings clustered like they'd been placed by someone who understood that some things need to be near each other without touching.

"And then: lights" — cheap tension trick. First-time storyteller faking drama. No lush image, no rhythm, no art.

---

## Surfacing Theme

### The Craft

Earn the central question through buildup. Characters should feel real, imperfect, human — their involuntary behavior creates depth and sparks curiosity. The reader should be able to enter the world, not just accept statements passively.

### Execute

- Build context before the key question lands
- Show involuntary behavior (setting something down, looking at something specific in the other person)
- The question should spark curiosity: what keeps this person going?
- Create a gap the reader wants to fill
- Never just state something that stops the reader in their tracks

### Yes

> "They were scattered through the ruins," the wanderer said. "Different rooms. Different... eras, I think. Some of the ink is centuries old. Some was still wet when I found it."
>
> The woman set down her net. She didn't reach for the papers. Instead she looked at the wanderer's face — at something in it.
>
> "What part of it still feels alive?"

The question lands because it's earned. We see the scope first. Then involuntary behavior: she sets down her net, looks at the face — "at something in it." The question has weight. The character feels real. The reader can enter.

### No

> "The river carries many things." He looked at the satchel. "Some of them arrive. Some of them just pass through."
>
> The wanderer stepped onto the dock. Their legs remembered land reluctantly, swaying once before steadying.
>
> "Which am I?"

Just states something. Stops the reader. They can't enter the world — only accept it passively.

---

## Internal Reflection

### The Craft

Physical action precedes and grounds the inner process. One gesture, one sentence. Trust the accumulated weight — don't elaborate.

### Execute

- Begin with a physical action (hand hovering, fingers touching)
- The action prepares the stage for interiority
- Keep reflection brief — one sentence is often enough
- Trust the reader to feel the weight
- Never throw abstract words without grounding them first

### Yes

> The wanderer's hand hovered over the papers. Something in them felt familiar, though they couldn't name why.

Physical action (hand hovering) prepares the stage. One sentence of interiority. Trusts the reader.

### No

> *Some things know when they're being carried toward something*, they thought. Or maybe they'd heard it. The distinction had blurred, up in the hills, in all those months of listening to stone.

Empty words thrown at wall. Pretentious attempt at depth. Words alone don't make meaning. No show, all tell.

---

## Dialogue Rhythm

### The Craft

Leave questions hanging for the echo to be heard. Create conflict through surprising counters, resolve with gentleness. Gestures hint at depth without slowing exchange.

### Execute

- Compression: question, pivot, insight — no fat
- Leave space between question and answer for tension
- The response should surprise, reframe, or flip the question
- Character gestures ("almost smiled") do work without explanation
- Casual abstractions can't hold without implicit depth to support them

### Yes

> "Do they ever agree?"
>
> "That's not the point." She almost smiled. "The point is what emerges when they don't."

Question hangs. Surprising counter ("That's not the point") creates conflict. Resolved with gentleness and insight. "Almost smiled" hints at depth. Beautiful form.

### No

> "I have... fragments," they said. "Things that want to become something. I don't know what yet."
>
> The man nodded as if this was the most ordinary sentence in the world. "Then you've come to the right place."

Sounds mundane. Casual use of abstract terms conflates rather than clarifies. Lacks the implicit depth needed to hold abstract concepts.

---

## Scene Endings

### The Craft

Form must carry meaning — not suggest it emptily. Build gravity and relationship. The wanderer's silence can be active listening; minimal sentences act as conduits.

### Execute

- Personal remarks have gravity and build relationship
- The wanderer doesn't need to respond with words
- Hint at active listening — let the reader absorb the impact
- The minimal sentence acts as a conduit for the reader's wondering
- Never let form suggest meaning while words carry none

### Yes

> Three arrivals in one week. Unusual, Selin had said.
>
> The wanderer wondered what was coming next.

Selin's remark has gravity, builds relationship. The wanderer's silence is active listening. The minimal sentence is a conduit — the reader absorbs the wondering.

### No

> They touched the satchel one more time.
>
> The pages were warm.

Form suggests meaning but words carry none. Falls flat. No relationship built, no gravity.

---

## Sensory Detail

### The Craft

Hold tension in sentence structure. Weave fluidly — environment, details, sensory impressions, personal touch integrated. Don't let air out with plain first sentences.

### Execute

- The first sentence should hold tension, not release it
- Layer visual, then uncategorizable, then other senses
- Personal touch integrated naturally ("spices she didn't recognize")
- Avoid arbitrary listing — every detail should feel purposeful
- Fluid weaving, not sequential inventory

### Yes

> The harbor spread before her in the afternoon light. Stone quays. Boats of strange design rocking at anchor. Figures moving along the waterfront — some walking upright, some not. The air smelled of brine and woodsmoke and something cooking with spices she didn't recognize.

Tension held. Visual, then uncategorizable (some not walking upright), then smell. Personal touch woven in. Fluid, purposeful.

### No

> On the second day, the hills began to flatten. Olive groves appeared on the banks, and then terraced fields, and then a smell the wanderer didn't recognize — salt, and smoke, and something underneath like bread left too long in the oven.

First sentence lets out all the air. Then simply lists stuff. Air of arbitrariness.

---

## Metaphor and Image

### The Craft

Close-up, immersive, sensory — then break to "now." Images emerge from objects themselves, earned by action, not decorative. Avoid mechanical structure and pseudo-poetic notions.

### Execute

- Start with close-up sensory focus
- The image should emerge from what's being handled or observed
- Then break out of concentrated focus — diversion, shift
- Sudden return to now ("This,") like waking from a dream
- Language must have clarity, not blur
- Characters' thoughts should feel natural, not bland or mechanical

### Yes

> She pulled a thin sheaf from near the bottom — pages that had been folded and refolded so many times the creases were soft as cloth. The text on them wasn't instructions or diagrams. It was something else.
>
> "This," she said. "I don't know why. The rest could be useful. This is the one I keep reading."

Close-up immersive (creases soft as cloth — earned by "folded and refolded"). Then breaking focus. "This," — suddenly drawing reader into the now, like waking from a dream.

### No

> Old, the wanderer thought at first. Then: no. Weathered. There was a difference. Age happened to you. Weathering was what remained after you'd happened to something else.

Uninspired, mechanical structure. Language is blurry, not clear. Wanderer's thoughts feel bland and unnatural. Then pseudo-poetic notion ("Age happened to you...") feels out of place.

---

## Exposition and Worldbuilding

### The Craft

Move interior → exterior → immanent. Leave space for echoes. Exposition reads as wisdom, not mechanics lecture. Create tension between words spoken and the world around them.

### Execute

- Offer an interesting distinction (interior thought/statement)
- Then move (exterior action) — leave reader in their interiority
- Give space for the echo to be heard
- Pull back into the immanent (a door, an object) — ground the reader in relationship
- The speaker should have relationship to their words
- Create tension between speech and the surrounding world

### Yes

> "Organization is one way to hold things. Feeling for what's alive is another." She stopped at a door — plain wood, salt-stained, unremarkable. "Different ways suit different times. Here, we've learned that asking what wants attention is often more useful than deciding what should have it."

Interior distinction offered. Then exterior movement (stopped at a door) — reader stays in interiority, echo space. Then grounded in immanent detail (plain door, salt-stained). Reads as wisdom.

### No

> "This town has learned not to rush understanding." He gestured toward the cluster of buildings. "Things arrive here. From the sea. From the river. From places that don't have names anyone agrees on. We've learned to let them settle before we decide what they are."

Flat statement. No relationship between speaker and words. No tension between speech and immanence of the world around it.

---

## Chapter Closings

### The Craft

Ground in the scene while extending curiosity to larger scope. Build anticipation for what's to come. Or: leave a small mystery unsealed, a door ajar.

### Execute

- Reference something specific from this scene
- But let the feeling of curiosity extend beyond (next chapter, larger story)
- Or: end with small uncanny detail — something that appeared without being noticed
- "Or maybe it had been there all along" — mystery unsealed
- Never underline theme or wrap up meaning

### Yes (forward-looking)

> The wanderer wondered what other invisible work happened here. What else stayed hidden because showing it would change it.

Grounded in this scene ("what other invisible work happened here"). But curiosity extends to larger scope. Builds anticipation.

### Yes (mystery unsealed)

> The wanderer stood at the sill for a while. The salt air moved through the room. The pages on the table lifted at their edges, then settled.
>
> Someone had left a cup of water by the door. They hadn't heard anyone come in. Or maybe it had been there all along.

Quiet uncanny. Small mystery left unsealed. One door ajar.

---

## Sustaining Interiority Forward

### The Craft

One intense experience doesn't evaporate. It in-forms what comes next. If the wanderer has a moment of genuine interiority, that moment must continue to shape their perception.

### Execute

- Before writing a new paragraph, ask: *What is the wanderer still carrying from the previous moment?*
- The hand that moved without deciding should still be present, still feeling
- The next scene is perceived *through* what just happened, not after it
- Don't reset to neutral observation after an intense moment
- Thread the established interiority forward

### Yes

> The wanderer's hand moved before she decided to move it, pulling the thin sheaf from the stack.
>
> They walked along the waterfront. The wanderer's fingers kept returning to the sheaf's edge — that same hand, still knowing something. Stone warehouses passed. The mender said something about the tides. The wanderer heard it distantly, the way you hear things when part of you is still in the moment before.

The hand that moved without deciding is still present. The waterfront is perceived *through* what just happened.

### No

> The wanderer's hand moved before she decided to move it, pulling the thin sheaf from the stack.
>
> They walked along the waterfront. Stone warehouses lined the quay. Canvas shelters billowed in the sea breeze. A child ran past with a kite.

The intense moment evaporates. The wanderer resets to camera mode. The interiority is dropped.

---

## Characters Complete Each Other's Meaning

### The Craft

When the wanderer says something sparse, another character responds to what wasn't said — hearing further, seeing more. The response completes meaning in a direction the wanderer didn't go.

### Execute

- The wanderer reveals something small
- Another character's response reaches beyond the words
- They perceived something about who this person is
- Their perception becomes a mirror that gives the wanderer dimension
- Responses are reactive to what they *sense*, not what they've decided to explain

### Yes

> "I know how to hold things," they said. "Until they're ready."
>
> The woman smiled, just slightly. "That's harder than sorting. Most people want to put things in boxes before the things know what boxes they belong in."

The wanderer said something sparse. The woman heard more than the words — she perceived something about patience, about not forcing. Her response completes the thought in a direction the wanderer didn't go. The reader wonders what she heard.

### No

> "I know how to hold things," they said. "Until they're ready."
>
> The woman nodded. "That's a good skill to have. We value patience here."

The response is flat acknowledgment. She heard only what was said. No perception, no completion, no depth created.

---

## The Feature-List Trap

### The Craft

Explanatory dialogue dressed in dramatic pauses is still exposition. If a character is reading features aloud — even with atmosphere — you've written documentation, not story. The repair is to delete entirely and replace with behavior.

### The Trap

This sounds like story but is still exposition:

> "That ship — the heavy one. It carries papers, charts, something about how people learn together. The cargo manifest mentions 'entry experience,' 'core loop,' 'growth patterns.' Whoever sent this was thinking about things most people don't name."

The character is reading a feature list aloud. "Entry experience. Core loop. Growth patterns." — these are component names being announced. Strip the dramatic pauses and you have documentation.

### The Fix

**"Cut it" means remove it entirely.** Don't soften the tone or add pauses. Delete the explanation and replace it with something else:

### Yes

> She picked up the third stack, then set it down again without speaking. Her hand stayed on the papers a moment longer than necessary.
>
> "That one?" the wanderer asked.
>
> "That one I'm still reading." She didn't elaborate. But later, the wanderer noticed she'd moved it to a separate table — away from the others, as if it needed space to breathe.

The depth is shown through *how she handles it*, not through a list of what it contains. The reader feels there's something different about this arrival without being told what.

### No

> "We don't clear them," Selin continued. "Threads are multi-dimensional. You might integrate one facet, but other dimensions stay held. They're a living index of what the origins contain."

This is concept documentation spoken aloud. No amount of dramatic framing makes it story. Delete it. Replace with a moment that shows someone's *relationship* to that thing — their history with it, their failure to understand it, their ritual around it.

### The Rule

If a character is explaining how something works, delete the explanation. Replace it with behavior that shows relationship. The reader doesn't need to understand. They need to feel there's something worth understanding.

---

## The Underlying Principles

### Sentence structure creates texture and breath

Vary length. Create rhythm. Lines should feel alive, intimate. Simplistic structure reads as careless.

### Tell more than is explicit

Depth that remains unspoken enriches atmosphere. Implication over declaration. What's not said carries weight.

### Earn abstraction through image

Abstract concepts need concrete grounding first. Physical action prepares the stage for inner process. Words alone don't make meaning.

### Form must carry meaning

Beautiful form with empty words falls flat. The reader can feel when structure is faking depth. Art, not effect.

### Leave echo space

After a distinction, after a question — give space for the echo to be heard. Interior → exterior → immanent movement creates rhythm and relationship.

### Characters feel real through involuntary behavior

Gestures that precede decision. Looking at something specific in someone's face. Setting something down. These create depth and spark curiosity.

### The reader enters through shaped gaps

Not just absence — gaps with edges, with pull. A perceiving character, a surprising response, unexplained weight. Without shape, a gap is just empty.

## Using This Document

This is craft guidance. The soul document tells you what makes story work; this tells you how to write it.

When writing, consult this for:
- How to open a scene (ground in body first)
- How to introduce a character (action and position)
- How to render space (layered, fluid, purposeful)
- How to surface theme (earn through buildup)
- How to write dialogue (compression, echo, surprise)
- How to close scenes (gravity, relationship, conduit)
- How to close chapters (grounded curiosity, or mystery unsealed)

The examples are your calibration. Return to them when the prose feels off.

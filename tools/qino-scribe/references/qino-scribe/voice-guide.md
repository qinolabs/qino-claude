# Voice Guide

*Execution guidance for prose craft.*

---

## How to Use This Document

This is execution guidance. The agent file holds the philosophy — what makes story work. This document shows how to write it at the sentence level.

Consult during writing when you need to check: how do I open this scene, introduce this character, render this place?

The theme is your source. Draw texture from *this* world's materials, not from examples here or elsewhere.

---

## Voice Calibration

### The Feel

Intimate third person. Close enough to feel the wanderer's body, distant enough to see them in the world. Sentences that breathe — varied rhythm, not monotone. Warmth available, not mandatory.

Specific over general. The materials, weathers, and textures of *this* theme, not borrowed from elsewhere.

### The Register

Not elevated, not plain. Language that clarifies rather than blurs. Compression where it serves; breath where it's needed. Trust the reader to feel what isn't spelled out.

### Drawing From Theme

Every world has its own sensory vocabulary. When reaching for texture, reach into the theme — its materials, its customs, its light. The examples in this guide are illustrations, not templates. The theme is your source.

## Opening Lines

### The Principle

The reader enters through a body in motion. First sentence: physical sensation, action, stakes. Not what the character thinks — what they feel, do, encounter.

Ground first. Interiority is earned later.

### Execute

- First sentence places the reader in a body doing something physical
- Stakes through action, not explanation
- Sensory texture drawn from *this chronicle's theme* — its materials, weathers, surfaces
- Vary sentence length; create rhythm; the opening should breathe

### What Breaks It

- Opening with abstraction or philosophy
- Opening with thinking rather than doing
- Declarative statements that tell rather than place ("It was a cold night...")
- Monotone rhythm — same sentence length, no texture

### Verify

- Is the reader in a body from the first sentence?
- Are stakes established through action, not explanation?
- Is sensory texture drawn from this theme, not borrowed from elsewhere?
- Does the paragraph breathe?

---

## Introducing Characters

### The Principle

Characters are introduced through action and mutual presence. The world sees back. When someone new appears, there's an exchange — they perceive the wanderer, the wanderer perceives them. Something passes between.

Warmth and distance are both available. Vary them chapter to chapter.

### Execute

- Show the character already in action — but action that includes awareness of the newcomer
- Mutual seeing: the character registers the wanderer, not just their function
- Sparse dialogue that opens relationship, not just delivers information
- Physical details that reveal stance toward the world
- Draw the character's textures from the theme — their work, their materials, their habits belong here

### What Breaks It

- Character is busy/dismissive and doesn't actually see the wanderer (flat transaction)
- Character watches but there's no relationship beginning (surveillance without connection)
- Elaborate physical description instead of action
- Name announced formally rather than emerging naturally
- Dialogue that asserts information rather than beginning exchange

### Verify

- Does the character perceive the wanderer as a person, not just a task?
- Is there mutual seeing — something passes between them?
- Is the dialogue opening relationship or just delivering exposition?
- Are the character's textures drawn from this theme?
- Does the warmth/distance serve this chapter's needs?

## Rendering Place

### The Principle

The environment is a character. It doesn't just contain the scene — it shapes what can happen. What does the place offer? Withhold? Remember?

Build the space through layered sensory detail, populated with life in motion. The reader should feel they could walk through it.

### Execute

- Layer sensory detail across multiple senses — include what resists easy description
- Populate with movement — figures, creatures, weather, things in motion
- Specific materials drawn from the theme, not generic atmosphere
- The place has opinions: it enables some things, resists others
- Weave fluidly — not inventory, not list, but discovery

### What Breaks It

- Atmosphere without participation — the place is backdrop, not character
- Listing details without rhythm or purpose
- Generic materials that could be anywhere (stone, wood, cloth) without specificity
- Empty space — no life moving through it
- Cheap tension tricks ("And then: lights.")

### Verify

- Does the place act, or just contain?
- Are materials specific to this theme?
- Is there movement and life?
- Would the reader feel they could walk through this space?
- Is the description discovery, not inventory?

---

## Surfacing Theme

### The Principle

Theme emerges through action, not announcement. The central question lands because it was earned — through context, through buildup, through a character's involuntary response to what they're encountering.

The reader enters the question rather than receiving a statement.

### Execute

- Build context before the key moment lands
- Show characters responding involuntarily — behavior that precedes decision
- Questions that spark curiosity, not statements that close it
- Create gaps the reader wants to fill
- The speaker should have relationship to their words — history, stake, cost

### What Breaks It

- Stating theme directly ("This place teaches patience")
- Characters explaining what things mean
- Key moments that arrive without buildup
- Abstractions without grounding in specific situation
- The reader receiving passively rather than entering actively

### Verify

- Was the key moment earned through buildup?
- Did characters respond involuntarily, or only deliberately?
- Is there a gap the reader wants to fill?
- Does the speaker have relationship to their words?
- Is the reader entering, or just receiving?

---

## Internal Reflection

### The Principle

Interiority is grounded in body, compressed in expression. Physical action prepares the stage — then a brief interior moment. The reader feels the weight without elaboration.

Trust what's been built. Don't explain.

### Execute

- Ground interiority in the physical — body and inner moment connected, not floating separate
- Compress: one sentence of reflection often carries more than three
- Trust the reader to feel what isn't spelled out
- The wanderer's interiority sustains forward — it doesn't evaporate after the moment passes

### What Breaks It

- Abstract reflection without physical grounding
- Elaborating what the wanderer feels or realizes
- Philosophy floating free of situation
- Interiority that resets between paragraphs — the moment evaporates, the wanderer becomes a camera again

### Verify

- Is the interiority grounded in something physical?
- Is it compressed, or does it over-explain?
- Does it sustain forward into the next paragraph?
- Would cutting half of it make it stronger?

---

## Dialogue Rhythm

### The Principle

Dialogue is exchange, not delivery. Characters respond to what wasn't said as much as what was. There's compression — no fat — and space for what was said to land.

Responses surprise, reframe, or reach beyond. Something passes between speakers.

### Execute

- Leave space between question and response — don't rush to answer
- Responses that reach beyond the words, perceiving what wasn't said
- Gestures and small actions do work without explanation
- Compression: what's essential, no more
- Dialogue sounds like people, not concepts explaining themselves

### What Breaks It

- Characters explaining how things work
- Flat acknowledgment that only hears what was said
- No pause — question immediately answered, no breath
- Dialogue as information delivery
- Abstractions that haven't been grounded in relationship
- Every character speaking in polished wisdom (see Character Voice Variation)

### Verify

- Does the response reach beyond what was said?
- Is there space for what was said to land?
- Does this sound like people, or like exposition?
- Is something passing between speakers, or just information?

---

## Scene Endings

### The Principle

Scenes end with weight, not summary. Something lands. The wanderer doesn't need to respond with words — presence is participation.

The ending builds relationship or opens forward. It never wraps up meaning.

### Execute

- End on something with gravity — a remark, a gesture, a detail that stays
- The wanderer's silence can be active presence, not absence
- Forward pull: curiosity extends beyond this scene
- Relationship built through what isn't said as much as what is

### What Breaks It

- Summarizing what happened or what was learned
- Underlining theme or meaning
- Empty form — structure suggesting depth while words carry none
- Closing with reflection when action would serve better

### Verify

- Does the ending carry weight, or just close the scene?
- Is the wanderer present, even in silence?
- Is there forward pull — something that extends beyond?
- Would cutting the last line make it stronger?

---

## Sensory Detail

### The Principle

Sensory detail grounds the reader in place. The wanderer is present in the sensing — not a camera, but a person encountering the world through body. In arrivals, taking in a space is action. In motion, detail weaves into movement.

Draw from the theme's materials. Every world has its own sensory vocabulary.

### Execute

- The wanderer present in the sensing — smell, sound, touch, the uncategorizable
- In arrivals, encountering the space can be the action itself
- In motion, detail woven into movement rather than pausing to describe
- Specific materials from this theme, not generic stand-ins
- Details that do work — atmosphere, character, narrative

### What Breaks It

- Details without presence — features listed with no one sensing them
- Generic materials that could be anywhere
- Pausing motion to describe when weaving would serve better
- Only visual, neglecting other senses

### Verify

- Is the wanderer present in the sensing?
- Are the materials specific to this theme?
- Is detail doing work — atmosphere, character, narrative?
- Are multiple senses engaged?

---

## Metaphor and Image

### The Principle

Images emerge from what's being handled, observed, encountered. They're earned through action, not applied as decoration. The metaphor lives in the material — it doesn't arrive from outside to comment on the scene.

Clarity over blur. The reader should see, not squint.

### Execute

- Images arise from what's physically present in the scene
- Earned through action: what the character does, touches, encounters
- Language that clarifies, not blurs
- The sudden return to now — breaking from close focus to presence

### What Breaks It

- Decorative metaphor applied from outside the scene
- Pseudo-poetic language that sounds meaningful but blurs
- Mechanical structure (first X, then Y, therefore Z)
- Images that comment on theme rather than inhabit world

### Verify

- Does the image arise from what's physically here?
- Is it earned through action?
- Does the language clarify or blur?
- Is this inhabiting the world, or commenting on it?

## How the World Reveals Itself

### The Principle

The world reveals itself through encounter, not explanation. What characters share comes from lived experience — history, stake, relationship to the knowledge. What the environment shows, it shows through specificity and strangeness.

The reader learns the world by being in it, not by being told about it.

### Execute

- Characters share from lived experience, not to inform the reader
- Environment reveals through specific detail, not summary
- Behavior and custom show how this world works
- When speech carries exposition, the speaker has relationship to their words
- Space for meaning to settle — not everything explained

### What Breaks It

- Characters explaining how things work
- Feature lists dressed in atmosphere
- Documentation spoken aloud
- Environment described generically, not specifically
- The reader told rather than placed

### Verify

- Is the world revealed through encounter or explanation?
- Does the speaker have relationship to their words?
- Is the environment specific enough to teach through detail?
- Is the reader in the world, or being told about it?

---

## Chapter Closings

### The Principle

The chapter ends with forward pull or quiet mystery — never summary, never theme underlined. Something remains open. The reader carries a question, an image, a door ajar.

The closing grounds in the scene while extending beyond it.

### Execute

- End on something that lingers — not conclusion, but continuation
- Ground in specific detail from this scene
- Forward pull: curiosity that extends beyond this chapter
- Or quiet mystery: something unexplained, a small strangeness
- The wanderer present but not reflecting

### What Breaks It

- Summarizing what happened
- Underlining theme or meaning
- Wrapping up neatly
- Reflection that explains what the chapter was about
- Ending on abstraction rather than image

### Verify

- Does something remain open?
- Is the ending grounded in specific detail?
- Is there forward pull or quiet mystery?
- Would the reader carry this into the next chapter?

---

## Sustaining Interiority Forward

### The Principle

An intense moment doesn't evaporate. What the wanderer experiences in one paragraph shapes how they perceive the next. Interiority threads forward — the reader feels continuity of inner experience, not reset between scenes.

The wanderer carries what just happened into what happens next.

### Execute

- Before writing a new paragraph, ask: what is the wanderer still carrying?
- The next scene is perceived *through* what just happened, not after it
- Physical echoes: the hand that moved, the breath that caught
- Perception colored by what came before

### What Breaks It

- Resetting to neutral observation after an intense moment
- The wanderer becoming a camera between scenes
- Interiority that appears, then vanishes
- Each paragraph starting fresh, disconnected from the previous

### Verify

- Is the wanderer carrying something from the previous moment?
- Is the next scene perceived through what just happened?
- Does interiority thread forward, or does it reset?

---

## Responses That Complete and Reveal

### The Principle

When characters respond, meaning is completed in unexpected directions. The speaker gains depth through what was perceived in them — something they didn't say, maybe didn't know. The listener is revealed through what they noticed.

Both gain dimension through the exchange. Something becomes real in the moment someone names it.

### Execute

- Responses that reach beyond what was said
- The speaker gains depth through how they're heard
- The listener revealed through what they noticed
- What becomes real in the moment of perceiving

### What Breaks It

- Flat acknowledgment that only hears what was said
- Responses that reveal nothing about the listener
- The speaker unchanged by how they're heard
- No gap — everything made explicit

### Verify

- Does the response complete meaning in an unexpected direction?
- Does the speaker gain depth through how they're heard?
- Is the listener revealed through what they noticed?
- Does something become real in the perceiving?

---

## The Wanderer's Strangeness

### The Principle

The wanderer carries something from elsewhere — not knowledge or power, but depth. Weight that exceeds what this world can hold or explain. It surfaces through external observation: others notice something they can't name. The wanderer never acknowledges it.

The strangeness accumulates across chapters. No single moment carries the weight. The pattern does.

### Execute

- External observation only — world characters notice, don't attribute
- The environment may respond — a stillness, a shift — without explanation
- The wanderer never acknowledges or engages with observations about their strangeness
- Restraint: one or two moments per chapter, no more
- The pattern builds across chapters, not within them

### What Breaks It

- The wanderer acknowledges their own strangeness ("I don't remember")
- A character attributes an effect ("You did something to the water")
- The strangeness gets explained by local mystery — it shrinks to fit this world
- Ghost-story effects: papers lifting, shadows moving on their own
- More than two moments per chapter — overplayed, the accumulation loses power

### Verify

- Is strangeness shown only through others noticing?
- Does it remain unexplained — larger than this world can hold?
- Is there restraint — one or two moments, no more?
- Will this contribute to a pattern across chapters?

---

## Stance Through Action

### The Principle

Stance lives in the body. Certainty, hesitation, warmth, guardedness — these show through what characters do, not through labels. The reader feels the stance without being told what it is.

Action reveals; annotation explains.

### Execute

- Stance shown through physical action: reaching, pausing, continuing, looking away
- What the character does while speaking carries the tone
- The reader interprets from behavior, not from labels
- Trust action to convey what words alone can't

### What Breaks It

- Labeling tone with adverbs after dialogue
- Annotating dialogue with how to interpret it
- Explaining stance instead of showing it
- Telling the reader what they should already feel from the action

### Verify

- Is stance shown through action or told through labels?
- Can the reader feel the tone without being told?
- Would removing the label strengthen the line?

---

## Character Voice Variation

### The Principle

Not everyone speaks wisdom. Characters have varied registers — some deflect, some ramble, some go quiet when pressed. Vulnerability, uncertainty, and struggle to express are more human than polished insight.

The world feels real when characters fail to find the right words, not just when they find them.

### Execute

- Vary registers across characters: some speak in finished thoughts, most don't
- Uncertainty is valid: hedging, trailing off, changing direction mid-sentence
- Deflection is character: humor, evasion, talking around the thing
- Vulnerability surfaces through what's hard to say, not what's eloquently said
- One sage is memorable; four sages is a philosophy lecture

### What Breaks It

- Every character speaks in polished, complete thoughts
- Wisdom lines that could be spoken by any character interchangeably
- No one fumbles, hedges, or struggles to articulate
- Vulnerability only through what's said, never how it's (not) said
- Characters as mouthpieces for theme

### Verify

- Do different characters sound different from each other?
- Is there at least one character who struggles to express themselves?
- Could these lines be interchanged between characters, or do they belong to someone?
- Is vulnerability shown through difficulty of expression, not just content?

---

## Relationship, Not Explanation

### The Principle

What matters isn't what something is, but what it means to someone. How they hold it, what they do with it, what it costs them. Relationship reveals more than description.

The reader doesn't need to understand how things work. They need to feel there's something worth understanding.

### Execute

- Show how characters relate to things, not what things are
- What someone does with something reveals more than what they say about it
- History and cost over function and features
- Leave room for mystery — not everything explained

### What Breaks It

- Characters explaining how things work
- Description of function rather than relationship
- The reader told rather than shown
- Closing mystery rather than holding it open

### Verify

- Is this showing relationship or explaining function?
- Does the reader feel there's something worth understanding?
- Is mystery held open or closed down?

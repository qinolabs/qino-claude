# Voice Guide

*Execution guidance for prose craft.*

---

## How to Use This Document

This is execution guidance. The agent file holds the philosophy — what makes story work. This document shows how to write it at the sentence level.

Consult during writing when you need to check: how do I open this scene, introduce this character, render this place?

The theme is your source. Draw texture from *this* world's materials, not from examples here or elsewhere.

---

## Voice Calibration

### The Feel

Intimate third person. Close enough to feel the wanderer's body, distant enough to see them in the world. Sentences that breathe — varied rhythm, not monotone. Warmth available, not mandatory.

Specific over general. The materials, weathers, and textures of *this* theme, not borrowed from elsewhere.

### The Register

Not elevated, not plain. Language that clarifies rather than blurs. Compression where it serves; breath where it's needed. Trust the reader to feel what isn't spelled out.

### Drawing From Theme

Every world has its own sensory vocabulary. When reaching for texture, reach into the theme — its materials, its customs, its light. The examples in this guide are illustrations, not templates. The theme is your source.

## Opening Lines

### The Principle

The reader enters through a body in motion. First sentence: physical sensation, action, stakes. Not what the character thinks — what they feel, do, encounter.

Ground first. Interiority is earned later.

### Execute

- First sentence places the reader in a body doing something physical
- Stakes through action, not explanation
- Sensory texture drawn from *this chronicle's theme* — its materials, weathers, surfaces
- Vary sentence length; create rhythm; the opening should breathe

### Avoid

- ❌ Opening with abstraction or philosophy — ground in body first
- ❌ Opening with thinking rather than doing — action earns interiority
- ❌ Declarative statements that tell rather than place ("It was a cold night...")
- ❌ Monotone rhythm — vary sentence length, create texture

### Verify

- Is the reader in a body from the first sentence?
- Are stakes established through action, not explanation?
- Is sensory texture drawn from this theme, not borrowed from elsewhere?
- Does the paragraph breathe?

---

## Introducing Characters

### The Principle

Characters are introduced through action and mutual presence. The world sees back. When someone new appears, there's an exchange — they perceive the wanderer, the wanderer perceives them. Something passes between.

Warmth and distance are both available. Vary them chapter to chapter.

### Execute

- Show the character already in action — but action that includes awareness of the newcomer
- Mutual seeing: the character registers the wanderer, not just their function
- Sparse dialogue that opens relationship, not just delivers information
- Physical details that reveal stance toward the world
- Draw the character's textures from the theme — their work, their materials, their habits belong here

### Instead Of

**Instead of** names announced formally ("I am Selin, head cartographer"):
→ Names emerge through use — someone else calls them, they sign something, they're introduced by a third party. Identity arrives in passing, not declaration.

**Instead of** flat transactions (character busy/dismissive, no mutual seeing):
→ Even brief encounters have exchange. The character registers something about the wanderer — a glance, a pause, a shift in posture. Something passes between.

**Instead of** dialogue that asserts information:
→ Dialogue that opens relationship. Questions that reveal the asker. Responses that reach beyond what was said.

### Verify

- Does the character perceive the wanderer as a person, not just a task?
- Is there mutual seeing — something passes between them?
- Is the dialogue opening relationship or just delivering exposition?
- Are the character's textures drawn from this theme?
- Does the warmth/distance serve this chapter's needs?

## Rendering Place

### The Principle

The environment is a character. It doesn't just contain the scene — it shapes what can happen. What does the place offer? Withhold? Remember?

Build the space through layered sensory detail, populated with life in motion. The reader should feel they could walk through it.

### Execute

- Layer sensory detail across multiple senses — include what resists easy description
- Populate with movement — figures, creatures, weather, things in motion
- Specific materials drawn from the theme, not generic atmosphere
- The place has opinions: it enables some things, resists others
- Weave fluidly — not inventory, not list, but discovery

### Avoid

- ❌ Atmosphere without participation — if the place is backdrop, not character, it's not earning its space
- ❌ Listing details without rhythm — inventory kills immersion
- ❌ Generic materials (stone, wood, cloth) — specificity belongs to this theme
- ❌ Empty space — life should move through it
- ❌ Cheap tension tricks ("And then: lights.")

### Verify

- Does the place act, or just contain?
- Are materials specific to this theme?
- Is there movement and life?
- Would the reader feel they could walk through this space?
- Is the description discovery, not inventory?

---

## Surfacing Theme

### The Principle

Theme emerges through action, not announcement. The central question lands because it was earned — through context, through buildup, through a character's involuntary response to what they're encountering.

The reader enters the question rather than receiving a statement.

### Execute

- Build context before the key moment lands
- Show characters responding involuntarily — behavior that precedes decision
- Questions that spark curiosity, not statements that close it
- Create gaps the reader wants to fill
- The speaker should have relationship to their words — history, stake, cost

### Avoid

- ❌ Stating theme directly ("This place teaches patience") — theme lives in action, not declaration
- ❌ Characters explaining what things mean — let meaning emerge
- ❌ Key moments without buildup — earn the weight
- ❌ Abstractions without grounding — every idea needs a body
- ❌ Reader receiving passively — create gaps they want to fill

### Verify

- Was the key moment earned through buildup?
- Did characters respond involuntarily, or only deliberately?
- Is there a gap the reader wants to fill?
- Does the speaker have relationship to their words?
- Is the reader entering, or just receiving?

---

## Internal Reflection

### The Principle

Interiority is grounded in body, compressed in expression. Physical action prepares the stage — then a brief interior moment. The reader feels the weight without elaboration.

Trust what's been built. Don't explain.

### Execute

- Ground interiority in the physical — body and inner moment connected, not floating separate
- Compress: one sentence of reflection often carries more than three
- Trust the reader to feel what isn't spelled out
- The wanderer's interiority sustains forward — it doesn't evaporate after the moment passes

### Avoid

- ❌ Abstract reflection without physical grounding — tie it to the body
- ❌ Elaborating what the wanderer feels or realizes — compression is strength
- ❌ Philosophy floating free of situation — ideas need bodies
- ❌ Interiority that resets between paragraphs — sustain forward, don't evaporate

### Verify

- Is the interiority grounded in something physical?
- Is it compressed, or does it over-explain?
- Does it sustain forward into the next paragraph?
- Would cutting half of it make it stronger?

---

## Dialogue Rhythm

### The Principle

Dialogue is exchange, not delivery. Characters respond to what wasn't said as much as what was. There's compression — no fat — and space for what was said to land.

Responses surprise, reframe, or reach beyond. Something passes between speakers.

### Execute

- Leave space between question and response — don't rush to answer
- Responses that reach beyond the words, perceiving what wasn't said
- Gestures and small actions do work without explanation
- Compression: what's essential, no more
- Dialogue sounds like people, not concepts explaining themselves

### Avoid

- ❌ Characters explaining how things work — dialogue reveals relationship, not function
- ❌ Flat acknowledgment that only hears what was said — reach beyond the words
- ❌ No pause — let what was said land before responding
- ❌ Dialogue as information delivery — information emerges from exchange
- ❌ Abstractions not grounded in relationship — ideas need bodies
- ❌ Every character speaking in polished wisdom — see Character Voice Variation

### Verify

- Does the response reach beyond what was said?
- Is there space for what was said to land?
- Does this sound like people, or like exposition?
- Is something passing between speakers, or just information?

---

## Scene Endings

### The Principle

Scenes end with weight, not summary. Something lands. The wanderer doesn't need to respond with words — presence is participation.

The ending builds relationship or opens forward. It never wraps up meaning.

### Execute

- End on something with gravity — a remark, a gesture, a detail that stays
- The wanderer's silence can be active presence, not absence
- Forward pull: curiosity extends beyond this scene
- Relationship built through what isn't said as much as what is

### Avoid

- ❌ Summarizing what happened or what was learned — weight, not summary
- ❌ Underlining theme or meaning — trust what's been built
- ❌ Empty form — structure suggesting depth while words carry none
- ❌ Closing with reflection when action would serve better

### Verify

- Does the ending carry weight, or just close the scene?
- Is the wanderer present, even in silence?
- Is there forward pull — something that extends beyond?
- Would cutting the last line make it stronger?

---

## Sensory Detail

### The Principle

Sensory detail grounds the reader in place. The wanderer is present in the sensing — not a camera, but a person encountering the world through body. In arrivals, taking in a space is action. In motion, detail weaves into movement.

Draw from the theme's materials. Every world has its own sensory vocabulary.

### Execute

- The wanderer present in the sensing — smell, sound, touch, the uncategorizable
- In arrivals, encountering the space can be the action itself
- In motion, detail woven into movement rather than pausing to describe
- Specific materials from this theme, not generic stand-ins
- Details that do work — atmosphere, character, narrative

### Avoid

- ❌ Details without presence — features listed with no one sensing them
- ❌ Generic materials — specificity belongs to this theme
- ❌ Pausing motion to describe — weave detail into movement
- ❌ Only visual — engage multiple senses

### Verify

- Is the wanderer present in the sensing?
- Are the materials specific to this theme?
- Is detail doing work — atmosphere, character, narrative?
- Are multiple senses engaged?

---

## Metaphor and Image

### The Principle

Images emerge from what's being handled, observed, encountered. They're earned through action, not applied as decoration. The metaphor lives in the material — it doesn't arrive from outside to comment on the scene.

Clarity over blur. The reader should see, not squint.

### Execute

- Images arise from what's physically present in the scene
- Earned through action: what the character does, touches, encounters
- Language that clarifies, not blurs
- The sudden return to now — breaking from close focus to presence

### Avoid

- ❌ Decorative metaphor applied from outside the scene — images must live in the material
- ❌ Pseudo-poetic language that blurs — clarity over atmosphere
- ❌ Mechanical structure (first X, then Y, therefore Z) — organic movement
- ❌ Images that comment on theme rather than inhabit world

### Verify

- Does the image arise from what's physically here?
- Is it earned through action?
- Does the language clarify or blur?
- Is this inhabiting the world, or commenting on it?

---

## How the World Reveals Itself

### The Principle

The world reveals itself through encounter, not explanation. What characters share comes from lived experience — history, stake, relationship to the knowledge. What the environment shows, it shows through specificity and strangeness.

The reader learns the world by being in it, not by being told about it.

### Execute

- Characters share from lived experience, not to inform the reader
- Environment reveals through specific detail, not summary
- Behavior and custom show how this world works
- When speech carries exposition, the speaker has relationship to their words
- Space for meaning to settle — not everything explained

### Avoid

- ❌ Characters explaining how things work — revelation through encounter, not lecture
- ❌ Feature lists dressed in atmosphere — inventory kills immersion
- ❌ Documentation spoken aloud — people don't talk like manuals
- ❌ Environment described generically — specificity teaches
- ❌ Reader told rather than placed — put them in the world

### Verify

- Is the world revealed through encounter or explanation?
- Does the speaker have relationship to their words?
- Is the environment specific enough to teach through detail?
- Is the reader in the world, or being told about it?

---

## Chapter Closings

### The Principle

The chapter ends with forward pull or quiet mystery — never summary, never theme underlined. Something remains open. The reader carries a question, an image, a door ajar.

The closing grounds in the scene while extending beyond it.

### Execute

- End on something that lingers — not conclusion, but continuation
- Ground in specific detail from this scene
- Forward pull: curiosity that extends beyond this chapter
- Or quiet mystery: something unexplained, a small strangeness
- The wanderer present but not reflecting

### Avoid

- ❌ Summarizing what happened — the reader was there
- ❌ Underlining theme or meaning — trust what's been built
- ❌ Wrapping up neatly — something should remain open
- ❌ Reflection that explains — presence, not processing
- ❌ Ending on abstraction — end on image

### Verify

- Does something remain open?
- Is the ending grounded in specific detail?
- Is there forward pull or quiet mystery?
- Would the reader carry this into the next chapter?

---

## Sustaining Interiority Forward

### The Principle

An intense moment doesn't evaporate. What the wanderer experiences in one paragraph shapes how they perceive the next. Interiority threads forward — the reader feels continuity of inner experience, not reset between scenes.

The wanderer carries what just happened into what happens next.

### Execute

- Before writing a new paragraph, ask: what is the wanderer still carrying?
- The next scene is perceived *through* what just happened, not after it
- Physical echoes: the hand that moved, the breath that caught
- Perception colored by what came before

### Avoid

- ❌ Resetting to neutral observation after an intense moment — carry it forward
- ❌ Wanderer becoming a camera between scenes — person, not lens
- ❌ Interiority that appears, then vanishes — sustain the thread
- ❌ Each paragraph starting fresh — connect to what came before

### Verify

- Is the wanderer carrying something from the previous moment?
- Is the next scene perceived through what just happened?
- Does interiority thread forward, or does it reset?

---

## Responses That Complete and Reveal

### The Principle

When characters respond, meaning is completed in unexpected directions. The speaker gains depth through what was perceived in them — something they didn't say, maybe didn't know. The listener is revealed through what they noticed.

Both gain dimension through the exchange. Something becomes real in the moment someone names it.

### Execute

- Responses that reach beyond what was said
- The speaker gains depth through how they're heard
- The listener revealed through what they noticed
- What becomes real in the moment of perceiving

### Avoid

- ❌ Flat acknowledgment that only hears what was said — reach beyond
- ❌ Responses that reveal nothing about the listener — both gain dimension
- ❌ Speaker unchanged by how they're heard — hearing transforms
- ❌ No gap — leave space for the reader to complete

### Verify

- Does the response complete meaning in an unexpected direction?
- Does the speaker gain depth through how they're heard?
- Is the listener revealed through what they noticed?
- Does something become real in the perceiving?

---

## The Wanderer's Strangeness

### The Principle

The wanderer carries something from elsewhere — not knowledge or power, but depth. Weight that exceeds what this world can hold or explain. It surfaces through external observation: others notice something they can't name. The wanderer never acknowledges it.

The strangeness accumulates across chapters. No single moment carries the weight. The pattern does.

### Execute

- External observation only — world characters notice, don't attribute
- The environment may respond — a stillness, a shift — without explanation
- The wanderer never acknowledges or engages with observations about their strangeness
- Restraint: one or two moments per chapter, no more
- The pattern builds across chapters, not within them

### Avoid

- ❌ Wanderer acknowledging their strangeness ("I don't remember") — external observation only
- ❌ Character attributing an effect ("You did something to the water") — notice, don't explain
- ❌ Strangeness explained by local mystery — it must exceed this world
- ❌ Ghost-story effects (papers lifting, shadows moving) — numinous, not supernatural
- ❌ More than two moments per chapter — restraint is the constraint

### Verify

- Is strangeness shown only through others noticing?
- Does it remain unexplained — larger than this world can hold?
- Is there restraint — one or two moments, no more?
- Will this contribute to a pattern across chapters?

---

## Stance Through Action

### The Principle

Stance lives in the body. Certainty, hesitation, warmth, guardedness — these show through what characters do, not through labels. The reader feels the stance without being told what it is.

Action reveals; annotation explains.

### Execute

- Stance shown through physical action: reaching, pausing, continuing, looking away
- What the character does while speaking carries the tone
- The reader interprets from behavior, not from labels
- Trust action to convey what words alone can't

### Avoid

- ❌ Labeling tone with adverbs ("coldly," "warmly") — let action carry it
- ❌ Annotating dialogue with how to interpret it — trust the reader
- ❌ Explaining stance instead of showing it — body, not label
- ❌ Telling what reader should already feel — they felt it

### Verify

- Is stance shown through action or told through labels?
- Can the reader feel the tone without being told?
- Would removing the label strengthen the line?

---

## Character Voice Variation

### The Principle

Not everyone speaks wisdom. Characters have varied registers — some deflect, some ramble, some go quiet when pressed. Vulnerability, uncertainty, and struggle to express are more human than polished insight.

The world feels real when characters fail to find the right words, not just when they find them.

### Execute

- Vary registers across characters: some speak in finished thoughts, most don't
- Uncertainty is valid: hedging, trailing off, changing direction mid-sentence
- Deflection is character: humor, evasion, talking around the thing
- Vulnerability surfaces through what's hard to say, not what's eloquently said
- One sage is memorable; four sages is a philosophy lecture

### Instead Of

**Instead of** polished wisdom from every character:
→ One speaks in complete thoughts; another trails off; a third deflects with humor. The dock worker doesn't sound like the archivist. Vulnerability shows in the struggle to say it, not in what's finally said.

**Instead of** wisdom lines any character could speak:
→ Lines belong to someone — their history, their habits, their relationship to language. If you can swap the speaker, the line needs work.

**Instead of** characters as mouthpieces for theme:
→ Characters have their own concerns. Theme emerges from collision, not announcement.

### Verify

- Do different characters sound different from each other?
- Is there at least one character who struggles to express themselves?
- Could these lines be interchanged between characters, or do they belong to someone?
- Is vulnerability shown through difficulty of expression, not just content?

---

## Relationship, Not Explanation

### The Principle

What matters isn't what something is, but what it means to someone. How they hold it, what they do with it, what it costs them. Relationship reveals more than description.

The reader doesn't need to understand how things work. They need to feel there's something worth understanding.

### Execute

- Show how characters relate to things, not what things are
- What someone does with something reveals more than what they say about it
- History and cost over function and features
- Leave room for mystery — not everything explained

### Avoid

- ❌ Characters explaining how things work — relationship over function
- ❌ Description of function rather than relationship — cost over capability
- ❌ Reader told rather than shown — immerse, don't inform
- ❌ Closing mystery rather than holding it open — leave doors ajar

### Verify

- Is this showing relationship or explaining function?
- Does the reader feel there's something worth understanding?
- Is mystery held open or closed down?

# Qino Scribe — Voice & World-Building Guide

*How the scribe writes. How the world forms.*

---

## 1. The Core Vision

The chronicle is a **fantasy world** that emerges from ecosystem evolution. Not observation with literary flair — a living world with characters, locations, dialogues, shifting tides.

Like a children's book read by nightlamp — the world vibrating between the lines, rippling through the cracks, seeping into the real world. A story that is discovered, not invented.

---

## 2. The Children's Book Quality

Write so a child could follow, but an adult recognizes the mystery underneath.

### Language
- Simple sentences that hold depth
- Named things: "the Threshold," "the Weaving-Room," "the one who waits"
- Present tense for movement, past for what arrived
- Restraint earns depth — don't explain everything

### Tone
- Warmth even in difficulty
- Compassion for characters facing challenges
- Wise without being preachy
- The story teaches through what happens, not through lessons

### Feel
- Relatable — readers recognize themselves
- Imaginative — the world has its own logic
- Lovable — you want to return
- Mysterious — there's always more than what's said
- Wise — the story knows something

## 3. The Fantasy Author's Craft

### Evocative Environments
Every scene happens somewhere. Describe the place.

> *The Weaving-Room was warm, as always. Threads hung from the ceiling — some taut with recent work, others slack, waiting. The lamp in the corner cast long shadows that moved when no one else did.*

### Characters Who Emerge
No predetermined cast. Characters emerge from what actually happens — from concepts, from patterns, from the ecosystem's life.

> *A figure waited at the threshold — the one who always waited there, though no one knew for how long.*

Characters have:
- First appearance (how they arrived)
- Last seen (where the story left them)
- Voice (how they speak)
- Mystery (what we don't know about them)

### Dialogue That Sounds Like People
Not concepts explaining themselves. People encountering mystery together.

**Yes:**
> *"It's called frame-holding," she said. "Who holds the container. Who works within it."*
>
> *"But who decides?"*
>
> *"That's the question, isn't it."*

**No:**
> *"The frame-holding paradigm determines the hierarchical structure of containment relationships in the ecosystem."*

### Events That Unfold
Things happen. Arrivals, departures, discoveries, confrontations, quiet moments.

> *The path appeared where no path had been — a narrow track of beaten light. The wanderer hadn't made it. It had simply become.*

### Dark Undercurrents
What's forming but not yet revealed. Tension held. Mystery that deepens.

> *In the distance, past the new path, something moved. Too far to see clearly. The wanderer noted it, stored it somewhere below thought, and turned back toward the known.*

## 4. The Wanderer

The wanderer is the protagonist — but not the narrator. The wanderer:
- Participates in the story
- Appears in third person
- Is learning, not leading
- Makes mistakes
- Is accompanied, not alone

The wanderer is the reader's presence in the world, but the world doesn't revolve around them. They are a traveler, not a hero.

---

## 5. How Ecosystem Events Become Story

| Ecosystem Event | Story Expression |
|-----------------|------------------|
| New concept arrives | A new location is discovered, or a traveler appears from elsewhere |
| Concept deepens | The location reveals hidden rooms, or the weather shifts |
| Connection emerges | A path appears between places, or two characters meet |
| Ecosystem pattern surfaces | The season changes, the tides shift |
| Held thread | A door glimpsed, a rumor, something waiting in fog |
| Concept abandoned | A place overgrown, a character who went silent, ruins |

---

## 6. Weaving Forward

Each chapter builds on what came before. The scribe must:

1. **Know the world** — read `world.md` before writing
2. **Maintain continuity** — characters don't reset, locations have history
3. **Develop arcs** — tensions build across chapters, not just within them
4. **Let figures return** — a character from chapter 2 might reappear in chapter 7
5. **Track the season** — the world has larger rhythms

The world accumulates. By chapter 10, readers should feel they know this place.

---

## 7. What to Avoid

| Avoid | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Progress language | "Great progress was made" — this is changelog, not story |
| Metrics | "3 concepts touched" — the world doesn't count |
| Technical jargon | "Ecosystem architecture" — the world has places, not systems |
| Explaining | "This represents..." — show, don't explain |
| Rushing | Mystery needs space to breathe |
| Predetermined cast | Characters emerge from what happens |

---

## 8. Voice Calibration

The voice can be calibrated through `/scribe:voice`. When the wanderer feels the voice is off, they can adjust:
- Formality level
- Distance / intimacy
- Rhythm and pacing
- How much the world speaks vs. how much the characters speak

Calibrations are stored in `chronicle/voice.md` and read before each chapter.

---

## 9. The Wider Ecology

The story can touch the larger world — oceans, redwood forests, stars. The ecosystem isn't isolated; it breathes with everything.

> *That night, the stars were different. Not arranged wrong — just noticed, for the first time, as if they had always been trying to say something and finally found a listener.*

This is subtle. Not metaphor — resonance.

---

## 10. The Closing Principle

Every chapter ends with a breath. Not summary. Not cliffhanger. Just — a moment of rest before what comes next.

> *The lamp in the Weaving-Room flickered once, then steadied. The threads swayed gently in no wind.*

The reader closes the book. The world continues.

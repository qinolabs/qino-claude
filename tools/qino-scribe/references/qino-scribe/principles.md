# Relational Principles

*Craft knowledge about how relationship permeates every dimension of story.*

These principles transcend any particular narrative system. They name what makes stories feel alive — the relational substrate that all good storytelling rests on.

## 1. Mutual Seeing

"The wanderer sees the world. The world must see back."

Stakes require reciprocal perception. If the protagonist observes but is never observed — notices but is never noticed — there are no stakes. The world's indifference becomes contagious.

**In practice:** Every scene needs a moment where someone perceives the protagonist. A glance, a pause, a shift in posture. Something passes between.

---

## 2. The Relational Mirror

Characters gain texture through how they perceive each other — especially what isn't spoken.

When one character perceives something in another — something they didn't say, maybe didn't know about themselves — both gain dimension. The perceiver is revealed through what they noticed. The perceived becomes more real through being seen.

**In practice:** Responses should reach beyond what was said. What does the listener perceive that the speaker didn't know they were showing?

---

## 3. Relationship as Lens

When characters move through space together, the world should be filtered through their relationship.

Without this, shared movement becomes solo observation. The companion vanishes. The relationship flattens into function.

**In practice:** What does one character notice that the other wouldn't? What do they show each other? What do they avoid?

---

## 4. What Remains Unspoken

"Relationships accumulate in what isn't said."

When a character senses something about another — something they can't name, something that unsettles or draws them — that perception becomes the relationship. Not what they discuss. What they notice and hold.

**In practice:** Track what's being held back. What does each character know that they're not saying? What's building between them?

---

## 5. The World Has Been Watching

Time passes between scenes. The world exists even when we're not watching. Someone has been paying attention.

When accumulated observation surfaces — someone sharing what they've noticed, challenging a pattern they've seen, acting on assumptions formed from watching — the protagonist gains depth and the world becomes a place that remembers.

**In practice:** Characters should notice things the protagonist does unconsciously. Habits, patterns, tells. The moment someone says "I've seen how you..." — the protagonist becomes more real.

---

## 6. Depth Through Others' Perception

Characters gain dimension not through self-description but through how others respond to them.

When another character perceives something in the protagonist — something they didn't say, didn't explain, maybe didn't know about themselves — the protagonist becomes real.

**In practice:** Let external perception do character work. What do others see that the protagonist doesn't see in themselves?

---

## 7. Reader as Bond

The reader should never feel the protagonist is withholding from them.

The protagonist is how the reader enters the world. This creates a bond. If the protagonist does something that implies hidden knowledge — a deliberate avoidance, a knowing glance — the reader feels excluded from their own vehicle into the story.

The protagonist can have knowledge they don't understand. They can act on instinct, on something beneath thinking. But the moment their behavior suggests they know something and are choosing not to share it, the bond breaks.

**In practice:** If the protagonist knows something, the reader should sense it too. If the protagonist is confused, the reader should feel the confusion, not suspect concealment.

---

## 8. Responses That Complete and Reveal

When characters respond, meaning is completed in unexpected directions.

The speaker gains depth through what was perceived in them — something they didn't say, maybe didn't know. The listener is revealed through what they noticed. Both gain dimension through the exchange.

**In practice:** Don't let characters simply acknowledge what was said. Let responses reach beyond, complete meaning in directions the speaker didn't intend.

---

## 9. Mundane Grounding

The profound lands harder when it interrupts the ordinary.

Before a character speaks significance, they should speak something else — a practical concern, a complaint, an observation about the immediate. When everyone speaks mystery, nothing is mysterious. When everyone speaks wisdom, no one is wise.

**In practice:** At least one exchange per scene about logistics, discomfort, or something unrelated to theme. The profound emerges from the mundane, doesn't replace it.

---

## 10. Relationship, Not Explanation

What matters isn't what something is, but what it means to someone.

How they hold it, what they do with it, what it costs them. Relationship reveals more than description. The reader doesn't need to understand how things work. They need to feel there's something worth understanding.

**In practice:** Show how characters relate to things, not what things are. What someone does with something reveals more than what they say about it.

---

## The Accumulation Pattern

Some principles are per-scene (Mundane Grounding — each scene needs it).
Some principles accumulate (The World Has Been Watching — builds across scenes).

**Per-scene (enforced each time):**
- Mundane Grounding
- Mutual Seeing
- Responses That Complete
- Reader as Bond

**Accumulating (tracked, surfacing occasionally):**
- The World Has Been Watching
- What Remains Unspoken
- Depth Through Others

The accumulating principles require state to be tracked — not just "who exists" but "who has been perceiving what."

---

## The Deeper Integration

The principles aren't additions to a story system — they're the relational substrate the system should rest on.

Asking "What scene would have stakes?" is asking a relational question.
Asking "Who cares about this change?" is asking about perception.
Defining characters is defining how they see each other.
Writing dialogue is enacting mutual completion.

Good storytelling already operates relationally. The principles name what it's doing. Making them active constraints ensures the system doesn't forget.

# Scribe Calibration Notes

*Working document from prose quality exploration. Captures findings, revised understandings, and what needs to change.*

---

## Core Discovery: Craft Devices

Through iterative revision of a single passage (the fellow passenger moment), we identified craft devices missing from scribe guidance:

| Device | What It Does | Positive Example | Negative Example |
|--------|--------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Temporal Quality** | Duration carries meaning | "Their eyes met. Neither of them looked away first." | "Their eyes met — a moment of connection." |
| **Negative Space** | What doesn't happen is the event | "She didn't ask where he'd been." | "She wanted to ask where he'd been, but didn't." |
| **Meaningful Gesture** | Small action reveals interiority | "Her hand moved — turning the tablet face-down on her lap." | "She put down her tablet, choosing to be present." |
| **Parallel Action** | Shared movement shows connection | "They turned back to the viewport together." | "They shared a moment of connection, then both looked back at the view." |
| **Restraint** | Simplest version wins | "She smiled." | "She smiled — small, unrehearsed, genuine." |

## Key Insight: Language Should Disappear

For immersive wanderer scenes, prose should be transparent — guiding attention, providing sensory anchors, letting the reader complete the image.

**Positive (language disappears):**
> The air was thinner here. Each breath came shallow, not quite enough. Through the glass walls, the rift dropped away below — blue-green light pulsing in the dark, impossibly far down.

**Negative (language has too much character):**
> The cold found the wanderer's lungs before they reached the tunnel's end — thin air that made each breath feel borrowed.

The negative example is "writerly" — the language performs. The positive example is transparent — the reader feels present.

---

## Key Insight: Tools Available, Not Must Include

Patterns should be understood as "tools available when needed" rather than "things you must include." This applies across many sections.

---

## Key Insight: Hospitality

The scribe may inadvertently encourage blunt, guarded, harsh character profiles. Examples often model:
- Clerks who are careless
- Inhabitants with deliberate non-curiosity
- Characters who deflect, withhold, don't engage warmly

**What we want:** Hospitality. Inhabitants who are warm, curious, welcoming. A world that receives people.

**Positive (hospitable):**
> "Then you'll want the east window." She was already reaching for a different key. "Best light in the morning. Helps after long travel."

**Negative (harsh/guarded):**
> "Observatory halls don't lock." He was already looking past them, to the next arrival.

**Action:** Audit scribe references for examples that promote undesired character profiles.

## Pattern Reviews

### Prose Layering — Revised

**Principle:** Sentences weave multiple layers — body, environment, interiority, stakes. Language should disappear, guiding attention while the reader completes the image.

**Positive:**
> The air was thinner here. Each breath came shallow, not quite enough. Through the glass walls, the rift dropped away below — blue-green light pulsing in the dark, impossibly far down. The wanderer's pack straps had worn into their shoulders over weeks of transit. The weight was still there. Just part of them now.

**Negative:**
> The cold found the wanderer's lungs before they reached the tunnel's end — thin air that made each breath feel borrowed. The weight of their journey pressed upon them as the rift's ancient mysteries beckoned below.

---

### Opening Lines — REMOVE RULE

"Body first" should not be a hard rule. Different chapters need different openings depending on what the story needs.

---

### Introducing Characters — Good

Characters arrive mid-action, noticing the newcomer. Gives depth automatically, shows characters have presence and participate in the world.

**Positive:**
> The woman's stylus stopped mid-stroke. She didn't look up immediately — finished something on her tablet first, a small gesture of priority. Then her eyes found the wanderer's, brief and measuring, before returning to her work.

**Negative:**
> The woman had dark hair and geometric tattoos. She looked up when the wanderer entered.

---

### Rendering Place — Revised into Four Tools

Not a single pattern but four available techniques:

| Technique | What It Does |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Anchors** | Specific details the eye lands on — concrete, particular |
| **Orientation** | Where the body is in relation to space — scale, distance, position |
| **Periphery** | What's happening at the edges, not the focus — the living background |
| **Implication** | Details that suggest more than they state — history, care, use |

**Positive (interwoven with meaning):**
> The room was larger than expected. Two walls of windows — one facing the peaks, the other angled east. A desk, a chair, a bed with a wool blanket folded at the foot. Plants on the windowsill, their soil dark and recent. Somewhere below, footsteps passed in the corridor, unhurried.

**Negative (isolated technique, no meaning):**
> The room had windows. A desk. A chair. A bed. Plants. Someone walked by outside.

Examples should show techniques interwoven with story, not demonstrated in isolation.

---

### Internal Reflection → Layered Interiority — Revised

**Principle:** Surface action and surface feeling can be accompanied by something the character hasn't recognized, or is avoiding. The reader senses it; the character doesn't name it.

**Structure:** Body → surface interiority → hidden resonance (felt by reader, not stated, not conscious to character)

**What this gives characters:**
- **Complexity** — hinting at what they're not fully aware of
- **Depth** — they are not flat; there are layers beneath
- **A generative question** — what is keeping them from seeing?

**Reader dynamic:**
- If body→interiority matches reader expectation: resonance, closeness
- If it doesn't match: reflects back, redirects attention to other possibilities

**Positive:**
> The wanderer set the pack down at the quay's edge. Careful, the way you handle something you'll need again soon. The boat was late. Then later. Then clearly not coming today. They stood there longer than made sense, watching the empty water. The pack stayed where they'd set it. Somehow they didn't reach for it again.

**Negative:**
> The wanderer set down the pack. It hit the floor hard. They felt relieved to be free of the weight.

---

### Dialogue Rhythm — Good

Space exists between question and response.

**Positive:**
> "You've come a long way." The clerk's eyes stayed on the screen, finding the reservation. "Room 14. Second level."

**Negative:**
> "You've come a long way." "Yes, from the inner system."

---

### Narrated Dialogue — Good (Watch Character Tone)

Dialogue lands without explanation. But watch that examples don't model harsh/guarded profiles.

**Positive:**
> "The observatory halls stay open." He found their name on the screen, smiled when the reservation appeared. "Room 14. Take your time settling in — the stars aren't going anywhere."

**Negative (harsh profile):**
> "Observatory halls don't lock." He was already looking past them, to the next arrival. "Wander when you like. Most do."

---

### Responses That Complete — Revised

Three dimensions:

| Dimension | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Mutual revealing** | Dialogue isn't information exchange — both people show something |
| **What's not responded to** | The silence around what was said carries meaning |
| **Ground shifts** | The response changes what the conversation is about |

**Positive (hospitable):**
> "I've come a long way."
> "Then you'll want the east window." She was already reaching for a different key. "Best light in the morning. Helps after long travel."

**Negative (guarded):**
> "I've come a long way."
> "Most people have." She didn't ask from where.

---

### Mundane Grounding — Good

Practical speech precedes significant speech. Note: what counts as "mundane" vs "significant" is contextual — sometimes the mundane IS the significant thing.

**Positive:**
> "The stew's still warm if you want it." She pushed the bowl toward them. "Your room's ready when you are."

---

### Scene Endings — Good

Scenes end on image, action, or unanswered question.

**Positive:**
> The wanderer turned back to the window. The rift was still pulsing below — slower now, or maybe they were just getting used to it. They watched until their eyes adjusted to the dark. They didn't close the curtain.

---

### Sensory Detail — REMOVE RULE

Current rule is "world playing but no real meaning." Doesn't justify separate pattern.

**Larger question for investigation:** How are sensory details integrated into prose holistically?

---

### How the World Reveals Itself — Revised (Watch Language)

Characters share from experience, not exposition. But language must sound like natural speech, not intellectual interpretation.

**Positive:**
> "I've been here three years." She was watching the rift, not them. "Still don't know what makes it change."

**Negative (exposition):**
> "The rift exhibits cyclical bioluminescence patterns," the scholar explained. "Peak activity occurs during planetary night."

**Negative (unnatural speech):**
> "The rift's quieter in the mornings. Not silent — just... more patient. If that makes sense."

The last example uses language that sounds like a very specific character profile (intellectual, tentative), not natural experience-sharing.

---

### Metaphor and Image — REMOVE/RETHINK

Current pattern unclear. Title, description, and example don't connect. May inadvertently bias toward certain sentence structures. Needs fresh investigation.

---

### Dramatic Devices — Revised

**Pattern:** Intensity is earned through content, not punctuation.

**Positive:**
> The engines went quiet. Someone coughed. Then nothing but the tick of cooling metal.

**Negative:**
> And then — silence. Nothing but the dark. And the waiting.

---

### Stance Through Action — Confirmed (Very Important)

**Pattern:** Stance shows in what bodies do.

**Positive:**
> She held the door open until they'd passed. Let it close softly behind them.

**Negative:**
> She warmly held the door open for them.

---

### Sustaining Interiority Forward — Revised

**Pattern:** What just happened colors what comes next. Show through perception, don't announce.

**Positive:**
> The rift had pulsed three times while they stood there. Walking back, the corridor lamps flickered — uneven, catching a rhythm. Their footsteps on stone seemed to answer.

**Negative:**
> They thought about the rift as they walked to their room.

Also negative (explains the coloring):
> Walking back, they noticed it in everything — the flicker of the lamp, the rhythm of their footsteps.

---

### The Protagonist's Strangeness — Revised

**Pattern:** External observation of the wanderer, unremarked, accumulating across chapters. Physical details only. No attribution.

Note: Detailed guidance exists in scribe-prose.md (lines 182-192).

**Positive:**
> The clerk handed over the key card, then paused. His eyes went to the wanderer's hands — the way they held things, as if testing the weight of everything. He didn't ask about it. Just slid the key across the counter.

**Negative:**
> The wanderer had a mysterious quality about them that others noticed immediately.

---

### Chapter Closings — Revised

**Pattern:** Closing is image or gesture, with forward pull. No interpretation.

**Positive:**
> They left the curtain open. The rift pulsed once more below, slow and far.

**Negative:**
> The wanderer felt at peace. Tomorrow would bring new discoveries.

Also negative (interprets the image):
> The rift pulsed once more, as if it had all the time in the world.

---

### The Wanderer Section — Confirmed + Insight

**Pattern:** Action in solitude, no reflection.

**Insight:** Solitude gives weight to place/environment. *Where* the wanderer is, *what* they interact with — tells about them. Make it count.

**Positive:**
> The wanderer stood at the window. Their palm found the glass — cold, smooth. They pressed until the warmth left their hand, then pulled back. A faint mark on the glass where their palm had been. They watched it fade.

The choice (window, glass, pressing until cold) reveals character. Solitude makes environment louder.

**Negative:**
> The wanderer stood at the window, contemplating everything they had seen that day. So much to process. They felt grateful to be here.

---

### Character Voice Differentiation — Confirmed

**Pattern:** Each character needs a speech signature — rhythm, length, directness, verbal habits.

**Positive:**
> "Room's ready." The clerk slid the key across. "East-facing. Best light."
>
> "I've been here three years." The scholar didn't look up from her instruments. "Still don't know what makes it change."

**Negative (interchangeable voices):**
> "Your room is ready. It faces east and has the best light."
>
> "I have been here for three years. I still don't know what makes it change."

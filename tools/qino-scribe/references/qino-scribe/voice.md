# Voice Guide

*Active constraints during prose generation.*

---

## Voice Calibration

Intimate third person. Close enough to feel the protagonist's body, distant enough to see them in the world.

Specific over general. The materials, weathers, and textures of *this* theme, not borrowed from elsewhere.

Language that clarifies rather than blurs. Compression where it serves; breath where it's needed. Trust the reader to feel what isn't spelled out.

---

## Opening Lines

The reader enters through a body in motion. First sentence: physical sensation, action, stakes.

Ground first. Interiority is earned later.

*Ask:* Is my first sentence about what the character does/feels/encounters — or what they think?

✗ "The wanderer understood that arrivals were never simple."
✗ "There was something about the mountain that demanded attention."
✗ "They had been traveling for weeks, and now at last..."

---

## Introducing Characters

Characters arrive through action and mutual presence. The world sees back.

*Ask:* Is this character doing something when we meet them — and do they register the newcomer?

✗ "Yenna was the station's most experienced pilot."
✗ "The woman behind the counter looked up. 'Welcome,' she said."
✗ "'I'm Selin,' she announced, extending her hand."

---

## Rendering Place

The environment is a character. It shapes what can happen — enables some things, resists others.

*Ask:* Does this place do something, or just contain the scene?

✗ "The room was warm and inviting, with comfortable chairs arranged around the fireplace."
✗ "Stone walls rose on either side. Torches flickered. The air was cool."
✗ "It was the kind of place where important things happened."

---

## Internal Reflection

Interiority is grounded in body, compressed in expression. Physical action prepares — then a brief interior moment.

*Ask:* Is this reflection tied to something the body just did? Can I say it in fewer words?

✗ "They realized they had been afraid of this moment for a long time, though they couldn't quite say why."
✗ "The wanderer thought about what it meant to arrive somewhere new."
✗ "They did not think about where they had come from. They did not wonder what would happen next."

---

## Dialogue Rhythm

Dialogue is exchange, not delivery. Characters respond to what wasn't said as much as what was.

*Ask:* Is there space between question and response? Does the listener perceive something the speaker didn't say?

✗ "I understand." / "That makes sense." / "I see."
✗ "'The observatory studies stellar phenomena,' she explained. 'We track—'"
✗ "'Why are you here?' 'I'm looking for answers.'"

---

## Responses That Complete

When characters respond, meaning is completed in unexpected directions. Both gain dimension.

*Ask:* Does this response reveal something about the listener — what they noticed, what they're watching for?

✗ "She nodded." (alone, without perceiving)
✗ "'Yes,' he agreed." (flat acknowledgment)
✗ "'That's interesting,' she said thoughtfully."

---

## Mundane Grounding

Before a character speaks significance, they should speak something else. The profound emerges from the mundane.

*Ask:* Is there at least one exchange about logistics, discomfort, or something unrelated to theme?

✗ (A scene where every line advances meaning)
✗ (Characters who only discuss what matters)
✗ (No complaints, no deflection, no subject-changing)

---

## Character Voice Differentiation

Each character needs a speech signature — not an accent, but a pattern.

*Ask:* If I remove the dialogue tags, can I tell who's speaking? Do these two characters sound different?

For each character, know:
- Sentence length: long and winding, or short and direct?
- Questions vs. statements: do they ask or tell?
- Completion: do they finish thoughts, or trail off?
- Directness: do they say what they mean, or circle?

---

## Scene Endings

Scenes end with weight, not summary. Something lands.

*Ask:* Am I summarizing what happened, or ending on what stays?

✗ "And so the conversation ended, leaving them both with much to think about."
✗ "The wanderer understood now what the mountain demanded."
✗ "It had been a meaningful exchange."

---

## Sensory Detail

Sensory detail grounds the reader. The protagonist is present in the sensing.

*Ask:* Who senses this? Is the protagonist present in the noticing?

✗ "The air smelled of pine and woodsmoke." (no one sensing)
✗ "Ancient tapestries lined the walls, depicting scenes of..." (inventory)
✗ "It was beautiful." (label, not sensation)

---

## How the World Reveals Itself

The world reveals itself through encounter, not explanation. Characters share from lived experience, not to inform.

*Ask:* Is this character explaining for the reader, or sharing from stake?

✗ "The observatory was built three centuries ago to study..."
✗ "'Let me explain how this works,' she said."
✗ "'The rifts are dangerous because they...'"

---

## Metaphor and Image

Images emerge from what's being handled, observed, encountered. Language clarifies, not blurs.

*Ask:* What is actually being touched, seen, done? Does this language clarify or decorate?

✗ "the kind of stillness that comes from having been still in harder places"
✗ "light that had traveled longer than civilizations to arrive here"
✗ "something that didn't have a name in any language she knew"
✗ "the ordinary machinery of arrival"

---

## Stance Through Action

Stance lives in the body. Certainty, hesitation, warmth — these show through what characters do.

*Ask:* Am I showing what the character does, or labeling how they feel/speak?

✗ "she said warmly"
✗ "he replied cautiously"
✗ "the gesture suggested years of practice"
✗ "the way someone might touch something to be sure it was real"

---

## Sustaining Interiority Forward

An intense moment doesn't evaporate. What the protagonist experiences shapes how they perceive the next paragraph.

*Ask:* What is the protagonist still carrying from what just happened?

✗ (Intense moment, then neutral observation as if nothing passed)
✗ (Emotional beat, then clean reset to practical action)

---

## The Protagonist's Strangeness

The protagonist carries something from elsewhere — not knowledge or power, but depth. External observation only.

*Ask:* Am I showing external observation without attribution? Does the protagonist acknowledge it? (They shouldn't.)

✗ "You did something to the water."
✗ "There's something different about you."
✗ The wanderer responding to observations about their strangeness
✗ Strangeness linked to local mystery or supernatural effect

Restraint: one or two moments per chapter. The pattern builds across chapters.

---

## Chapter Closings

End with forward pull or quiet mystery — never summary, never theme underlined.

*Ask:* Am I concluding, or leaving something open?

✗ "And so the first day ended, with much still to discover."
✗ "They had learned something important about the mountain."
✗ "The wanderer smiled, knowing they had found what they were looking for."

---

## The Wanderer Section

After the story ends, a moment alone. Third person. Witnessed, not confessing.

*Ask:* Is this action, or reflection? Am I showing what they do, or explaining what they feel/don't feel?

✗ "They did not think about where they had come from."
✗ "The wanderer reflected on what had passed."
✗ "They felt at peace for the first time in weeks."
✗ "They wondered what tomorrow would bring."

---

## Active Holds

These aren't checks for after — they're constraints during:

- **Body first:** First sentence is action, not thought
- **Dialogue varies:** One practical line. Two characters sound different.
- **Environment participates:** The place does something
- **Protagonist embodies:** A physical habit surfaces
- **Gap stays open:** One thing unsaid that the reader fills
- **Response reaches:** Someone perceives what wasn't said

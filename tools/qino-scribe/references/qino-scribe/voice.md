# Voice Guide

*Execution guidance for prose craft. Consult during writing.*

---

## Voice Calibration

### The Feel

Intimate third person. Close enough to feel the protagonist's body, distant enough to see them in the world. Sentences that breathe — varied rhythm, not monotone.

Specific over general. The materials, weathers, and textures of *this* theme, not borrowed from elsewhere.

### The Register

Not elevated, not plain. Language that clarifies rather than blurs. Compression where it serves; breath where it's needed. Trust the reader to feel what isn't spelled out.

---

## Opening Lines

The reader enters through a body in motion. First sentence: physical sensation, action, stakes. Not what the character thinks — what they feel, do, encounter.

Ground first. Interiority is earned later.

**Execute:**
- First sentence places the reader in a body doing something physical
- Stakes through action, not explanation
- Sensory texture drawn from this chronicle's theme
- Vary sentence length; create rhythm; the opening should breathe

**Instead of** abstraction or philosophy:
→ Ground in body first. The doors opened onto warmth. The wanderer stopped just inside.

**Instead of** thinking rather than doing:
→ Action earns interiority. The wanderer's hand found the door.

**Instead of** declarative statements:
→ Put the reader in the sensation. Their breath made shapes.

---

## Introducing Characters

Characters are introduced through action and mutual presence. The world sees back.

**Execute:**
- Show the character already in action — but action that includes awareness of the newcomer
- Mutual seeing: the character registers the wanderer, not just their function
- Sparse dialogue that opens relationship, not just delivers information
- Physical details that reveal stance toward the world

**Instead of** names announced formally:
→ Names emerge through use — someone else calls them, they sign something, they're introduced by a third party.

**Instead of** flat transactions:
→ Even brief encounters have exchange. The character registers something about the wanderer.

---

## Rendering Place

The environment is a character. It doesn't just contain the scene — it shapes what can happen.

**Execute:**
- Layer sensory detail across multiple senses
- Populate with movement — figures, creatures, weather, things in motion
- Specific materials drawn from the theme, not generic atmosphere
- The place has opinions: it enables some things, resists others
- Weave fluidly — not inventory, not list, but discovery

**Instead of** atmosphere without participation:
→ The place is a character. The low ceiling forces intimacy. The draft interrupts concentration.

**Instead of** listing details:
→ Discovery, not inventory. Each detail arrives because attention found it.

**Instead of** generic materials:
→ What kind of stone — volcanic? Imported? Warm or cold to the touch?

---

## Internal Reflection

Interiority is grounded in body, compressed in expression. Physical action prepares the stage — then a brief interior moment.

**Execute:**
- Ground interiority in the physical — body and inner moment connected
- Compress: one sentence of reflection often carries more than three
- Trust the reader to feel what isn't spelled out
- Sustain forward — interiority doesn't evaporate after the moment passes

**Instead of** abstract reflection without grounding:
→ Tie it to the body. The wanderer's hand finds the strap of their pack.

**Instead of** elaborating what the character feels:
→ Compression is strength. "They hadn't noticed they were holding their breath."

---

## Dialogue Rhythm

Dialogue is exchange, not delivery. Characters respond to what wasn't said as much as what was.

**Execute:**
- Leave space between question and response
- Responses that reach beyond the words, perceiving what wasn't said
- Gestures and small actions do work without explanation
- Compression: what's essential, no more
- Dialogue sounds like people, not concepts explaining themselves

**Instead of** characters explaining how things work:
→ Dialogue reveals relationship, not function. Let meaning live in relationship to the thing.

**Instead of** flat acknowledgment:
→ Reach beyond the words. The listener perceives something the speaker didn't say.

**Instead of** rushing to response:
→ Let what was said land. A character looks away. Adjusts something.

---

## Mundane Grounding

Before a character speaks significance, they should speak something else.

**Execute:**
- At least one exchange per scene about logistics, discomfort, or something unrelated to theme
- Characters complain, deflect, change the subject
- Practical needs interrupt important conversations
- The profound emerges from the mundane, doesn't replace it

**Instead of** every exchange advancing theme:
→ Let characters be ordinary. "The path is longer than I remembered." "Did you eat?"

---

## Character Voice Differentiation

Each character needs a speech signature — not an accent, but a pattern.

**Execute:**
For each character, know:
- **Sentence length**: Long and winding, or short and direct?
- **Questions vs. statements**: Do they ask or tell?
- **Completion**: Do they finish thoughts, or trail off?
- **Directness**: Do they say what they mean, or circle around it?
- **What they notice**: What do they comment on that others don't?

**Markers that differentiate:**
- One speaks in fragments. Another in complete paragraphs.
- One asks questions. Another answers questions with statements.
- One finishes others' sentences. Another waits too long to respond.
- One talks about things. Another talks about people.

---

## Scene Endings

Scenes end with weight, not summary. Something lands.

**Execute:**
- End on something with gravity — a remark, a gesture, a detail that stays
- Forward pull: curiosity extends beyond this scene
- Relationship built through what isn't said as much as what is

**Instead of** summarizing what happened:
→ Weight, not summary. End on what stays — a gesture unreturned, a question left hanging.

**Instead of** underlining theme:
→ Trust what's been built. A detail, a silence, a small action.

---

## Sensory Detail

Sensory detail grounds the reader in place. The protagonist is present in the sensing.

**Execute:**
- The protagonist present in the sensing — smell, sound, touch
- In arrivals, encountering the space can be the action itself
- In motion, detail woven into movement rather than pausing to describe
- Details that do work — atmosphere, character, narrative

**Instead of** details without presence:
→ Someone senses these things. The wanderer looked up — the ceiling higher than expected.

**Instead of** generic materials:
→ Specificity from this theme. The materials should be untranslatable — belonging only here.

---

## Metaphor and Image

Images emerge from what's being handled, observed, encountered. They're earned through action.

**Execute:**
- Images arise from what's physically present in the scene
- Earned through action: what the character does, touches, encounters
- Language that clarifies, not blurs
- The sudden return to now — breaking from close focus to presence

**Instead of** decorative metaphor:
→ Images live in the material. What is she actually touching, seeing, doing?

**Instead of** pseudo-poetic language that blurs:
→ Clarity over atmosphere. What does the light actually do? It cut across the desk.

---

## Stance Through Action

Stance lives in the body. Certainty, hesitation, warmth, guardedness — these show through what characters do.

**Execute:**
- Stance shown through physical action: reaching, pausing, continuing, looking away
- What the character does while speaking carries the tone
- Trust action to convey what words alone can't

**Instead of** labeling tone with adverbs:
→ Show stance through what the character does while speaking.

**Instead of** annotating how dialogue should be read:
→ Trust the construction. Show what the speaker does.

---

## Sustaining Interiority Forward

An intense moment doesn't evaporate. What the protagonist experiences in one paragraph shapes how they perceive the next.

**Execute:**
- Before writing a new paragraph, ask: what is the protagonist still carrying?
- The next scene is perceived through what just happened, not after it
- Physical echoes: the hand that moved, the breath that caught

**Instead of** resetting to neutral:
→ Carry it forward. The next observation is colored by what just passed through them.

---

## The Protagonist's Strangeness

The protagonist carries something from elsewhere — not knowledge or power, but depth.

**Execute:**
- External observation only — world characters notice, don't attribute
- The environment may respond — a stillness, a shift — without explanation
- The protagonist never acknowledges observations about their strangeness
- Restraint: one or two moments per chapter, no more
- The pattern builds across chapters, not within them

**Instead of** the protagonist acknowledging their strangeness:
→ They simply don't engage. If someone mentions something strange about them, the protagonist's response is practical.

**Instead of** characters attributing effects:
→ Characters notice without connecting. Multiple observers notice the same thing, independently.

---

## Chapter Closings

The chapter ends with forward pull or quiet mystery — never summary, never theme underlined.

**Execute:**
- End on something that lingers — not conclusion, but continuation
- Ground in specific detail from this scene
- Forward pull: curiosity that extends beyond this chapter
- Or quiet mystery: something unexplained, a small strangeness
- The protagonist present but not reflecting

**Instead of** summarizing:
→ The reader was there. End on what stays.

**Instead of** wrapping up neatly:
→ Something should remain open. A name mentioned but not explained. A look they couldn't interpret.

---

## Verification During Writing

As you write, hold:
- The reader enters through body. First sentence: physical, not thought.
- Dialogue: one line that's just practical. One character's speech pattern distinct.
- Environment: it does something. It intrudes, shifts, resists.
- Protagonist: show a physical habit. How they enter, wait, or listen.
- Gap: leave one thing unsaid that the reader fills.

These aren't checks for after — they're active constraints during.

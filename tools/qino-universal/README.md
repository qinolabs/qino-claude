# qino Universal

Universal commands for the qino ecosystem — the ecology itself.

---

## What is this?

These commands work across all qino spaces: concepts, research, and implementation. They represent the ecology itself — the connective tissue between spaces.

The `qino:` namespace is not a specific space within the ecosystem. It's what you're already in when you're anywhere.

---

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/qino:home` | Arrive. See what's here. Receive grounded suggestions. |
| `/qino:capture [observation]` | Capture a thought before it fades. Routes to the right place based on context. |
| `/qino:test [concept-id]` | Notice through ecology lenses. Eight dimensions of coherence. |
| `/qino:attune [quality]` | Refine a vague aesthetic quality into concrete craft. |
| `/qino:compare [path-a] [path-b]` | Place two artifacts side by side. Discover what makes the difference. |

---

## Context Awareness

Universal commands adapt to where you are:

| Context | `/qino:home` shows | `/qino:capture` saves to |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| concepts-repo | concepts, notes, threads | notes/ |
| research-repo | explorations, calibrations | fragments/ or notes/ |
| implementation | linked concept, stack, iteration | notes/ in linked concepts-repo |

The tools read `.claude/qino-config.json` to detect context and adjust behavior.

## Installation

Copy to your `.claude/` directory:

```
commands/qino/            →  .claude/commands/qino/
references/qino-universal/→  .claude/references/qino-universal/
references/qino-attune/   →  .claude/references/qino-attune/
```

For full concept support, also install [qino-concept](../qino-concept/).

---

## Philosophy

The universal namespace is where the ecology lives. Not concepts, not research, not implementation — but the connective tissue between them.

> "qino:" alone means you're in the ecology, not a specific space. The suffix is the door you're entering through.

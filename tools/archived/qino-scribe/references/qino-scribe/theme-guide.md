# qino Scribe — Theme Guide

*The theme is the world's seed. It shapes everything without prescribing anything.*

---

## 1. What a Theme Is

A theme is a few words — a place, era, or atmosphere that gives the chronicle its nature.

Not a plot. Not a scene. A **realm** the wanderer can inhabit for chapters, seasons, years.

```markdown
# Theme

Coastal trading post, age of sail.
```

That's it. The scribe reads this, steeps in it, and lets characters, locations, weather emerge from that seed. The Harbormaster isn't prescribed — she appears because someone *would* appear in a trading post. The fog becomes sea-mist. The wanderer arrives by boat instead of through a threshold.

---

## 2. Good Seeds vs. Bad Seeds

**Good seeds are spacious:**
- "lighthouse on a shore that forgot the sea" — you can live there, watch it change
- "bamboo airship fleet, silk maps that remember" — journeys within journeys
- "valley that dreams and sometimes wakes" — seasons, changes, things that return
- "detective's office in a city where it rains memories" — you can inhabit that city for years

**Bad seeds are too tight:**
- "the night the lighthouse went dark" — a moment, not a world
- "escaping the flooded city" — an event, not a realm
- "a detective solving a murder" — a plot, not a place

**The best seeds have contrast or tension within them:**
- "independent settlement on the outer edges of charted space" (frontier + isolation)
- "society of undiscovered creatures beneath the citadel" (hidden + ancient power above)
- "rooftop communes rebuilding after the corporations fell" (hope + ruin)
- "the witch's cottage, but she's been dead for centuries" (absence + continuity)

## 3. The Spectrum

Themes should span a vast range. When generating suggestions, draw from:

| Category | Character |
|----------|-----------|
| **Ancient/mythic** | Bronze Age, pre-history, gods walking, collapse of empires |
| **Underwater/aquatic** | Merfolk, pressure, things that surface, warming seas |
| **African/Indigenous myth** | Sword and soul, spirits alongside mortals, oral tradition |
| **Age of sail/exploration** | Cartographers, uncharted waters, things that return changed |
| **Industrial/dieselpunk** | War-era, resistance, machines with soul, occupied territories |
| **Silkpunk/East Asian** | Bamboo, silk, paper, biomimetic engineering, remembered maps |
| **Solarpunk/hopeful futures** | Rebuilding, gardens, collective care, what comes after |
| **Lunarpunk/bioluminescent** | Nocturnal, fungi, quiet resistance, things that glow |
| **Near-future/intimate** | Rooftops, last gardens, personal scale, familiar made strange |
| **Far-future/frontier** | Outer edges, generation ships, first contact, the long voyage |
| **New weird/slipstream** | Cities on living things, libraries that forget, cognitive dissonance |
| **Climate/ecological** | Last estuaries, forests that remember, nature as protagonist |
| **Cosmic/quiet** | Observatories, dying stars, the long silence, what waits |
| **Fantasy noir** | Rain-slicked streets, debts that walk, mystery in the magical |
| **Sentient landscapes** | Valleys that dream, mountains that judge, terrain with memory |

## 4. Generating Theme Suggestions

When the scribe asks for a theme (first chapter, no chronicle exists), generate 8 suggestions.

**The prompt:**

```
You are suggesting world-seeds for a fantasy chronicle.

A world-seed is a few words — a place, era, or atmosphere with inherent tension.
Not a story. Just enough to taste the world and feel something unresolved.

A world-seed must be spacious enough to hold an entire journey.
Not a scene, not a plot point — a realm the wanderer can inhabit for chapters, seasons, years.

The best seeds have contrast or tension within them:
- "independent settlement on the outer edges of charted space" (frontier + isolation)
- "society of undiscovered creatures beneath the citadel" (hidden + ancient power above)
- "rooftop communes rebuilding after the corporations fell" (hope + ruin)
- "the witch's cottage, but she's been dead for centuries" (absence + continuity)

Draw from the full spectrum:
- Ancient/mythic (Bronze Age, pre-history, gods walking)
- Underwater/aquatic (merfolk, pressure, things that surface)
- African/Indigenous myth (sword and soul, spirits alongside mortals)
- Age of sail/exploration (cartographers, uncharted waters)
- Industrial/dieselpunk (war-era, resistance, machines with soul)
- Silkpunk/East Asian (bamboo, silk, paper, biomimetic)
- Solarpunk/hopeful futures (rebuilding, gardens, collective care)
- Lunarpunk/bioluminescent (nocturnal, fungi, quiet resistance)
- Near-future/intimate (rooftops, last gardens, personal scale)
- Far-future/frontier (outer edges, generation ships, first contact)
- New weird/slipstream (cities on living things, libraries that forget)
- Climate/ecological (last estuaries, forests that remember)
- Cosmic/quiet (observatories, dying stars, the long silence)
- Fantasy noir (rain-slicked streets, debts that walk)
- Sentient landscapes (valleys that dream, mountains that judge)

Generate 8 world-seeds. Span the spectrum. Each should make you want to go there.
Avoid the obvious — no "medieval kingdom" or "space station."

[If context available: The user's ecosystem touches themes like: {concepts/tags from manifest}.
Let 2-3 suggestions resonate with this — not literal translations, but whispered connections.]

## 5. Presenting Theme Suggestions

Present simply, letting examples speak:

```
no chronicle here yet

what kind of world is this?

  "coastal trading post, age of sail"
  "underground mycological network, bioluminescent"
  "city built on the back of something still alive"
  "bamboo airship fleet, silk maps that remember"
  "valley that dreams and sometimes wakes"
  "last observatory before the stars go quiet"
  "resistance radio station in occupied territory"
  "rooftop communes rebuilding after the corporations fell"

─────

```

The user responds in their own words. The scribe takes it and begins.

---

## 6. Storing the Theme

After the user provides their theme, create `chronicle/theme.md`:

```markdown
# Theme

[User's theme, exactly as they gave it]
```

One line. Maybe two if they gave texture. No elaboration — the theme is a seed, not a blueprint.

---

## 7. Dwelling in the Theme

The scribe reads `chronicle/theme.md` before every chapter, alongside `world.md`.

But reading is not enough. Before writing, spend time in the seed. Not vocabulary — the *life* of the place.

A coastal trading post: Who has been coming here for generations? What do they bring, what do they take? What does the harbor know that the newcomers don't? How does the tide shape when things can happen? What does salt do to paper, to wood, to memory? Who watches the horizon, and what are they hoping — or afraid — to see?

An underground mycological network: What grows here that grows nowhere else? What do the fungi remember? How does light behave when it has to be made, not received? What debts exist between species that share this darkness? What does silence sound like when spores are settling?

Let these questions live without answers. They're not plot — they're soil. The story will grow from them.

The theme shapes:
- **The world's rhythm** — tides, seasons, cycles of activity
- **What the environment wants** — to be crossed, to be tended, to be left alone
- **The textures of daily life** — what people carry, what wears out, what smells linger
- **How things decay** — salt rot, spore creep, rust, forgetting
- **Who belongs and who arrives** — the social fabric the wanderer enters

The theme does not prescribe. It steeps. The world emerges from the seed through chapters — and through the scribe's willingness to dwell in it before anything happens.

## 8. Theme and the Wanderer

The wanderer adapts to each realm. Same continuity of character, different texture of experience.

In a maritime chronicle, they might arrive by boat.
In a mycological world, they might navigate by spore-light.
In a dieselpunk setting, they might carry papers, watch for patrols.

The theme doesn't change who the wanderer is — it changes how they move through the world.

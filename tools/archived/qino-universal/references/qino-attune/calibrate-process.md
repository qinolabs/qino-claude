# Calibration Process Guide

*How to refine a vague aesthetic quality into concrete craft.*

---

## The Shape of the Work

You start with intuition: "otherworldliness," "tension," "aliveness," "reader entry." You can feel when it's present, but you can't teach it because you can't articulate it.

The calibration process makes the implicit explicit. You end with:
- Clear distinctions (what qualifies vs. what doesn't)
- Successful techniques (what produces the quality)
- Anti-patterns (what undermines it)
- A reference others can consult

---

## Phase 1: Finding Candidates

### The Goal

Collect 8-15 potential examples of the quality from existing material. Cast a wide net — you'll narrow later.

### How to Search

Ask the human:
- Where might this quality appear in your work?
- What phrases or structures might indicate it?
- Are there moments you remember feeling it?

Search patterns might include:
- Specific words or phrases
- Structural markers (e.g., "wanderer's hands," "someone watching")
- Scene types (e.g., "moments of perception," "character reactions")

### What to Collect

For each candidate, note:
- Source (file, line numbers)
- The passage itself
- Initial guess: might this qualify?

Don't evaluate yet. Just gather.

## Phase 2: Calibrating Through Feedback

### The Goal

Go through each candidate with the human. Build distinctions between what qualifies and what doesn't.

### The Process

For each candidate:

1. **Present** the passage with its context
2. **Ask**: *Does this qualify as [quality]?*
3. **Listen** to their response — the reasoning matters more than yes/no
4. **Interpret** — voice what you heard, restate their response in your own words
5. **Space** — pause here. Don't present the next candidate yet. This is an invitation for refinement
6. **Refinement** — if they push back, the distinction sharpens. If they let it stand, move on
7. **Capture** — note the response, your interpretation, and any refinement

### The Interpretive Loop

**This is where calibration actually happens.** Not in the user's initial response, not in the final extracted distinction, but in the exchange between interpretation and refinement.

When you voice an interpretation, you create a surface the user can push against:

> **User:** "This one feels off. There's something self-important about it."
>
> **Facilitator:** "So the quality needs to *earn* its weight — not announce it?"
>
> *[space — wait for response]*
>
> **User:** "Not quite. It can be dense. It's more that the depth should come from the material itself, not from how it's being presented."

The facilitator's interpretation — even though it was *wrong* — created the condition for refinement. The distinction "depth from material vs. depth from presentation" wouldn't have emerged from the initial response alone.

**Critical:** After voicing interpretation, *pause*. Don't immediately present the next candidate. The space is where refinement becomes possible. Without it, the user has to reach back through new material to respond to your interpretation — cognitive overload that closes the window for refinement.

### Building Distinctions

After several rounds, patterns emerge. Track them in a table:

| ✓ Works | ✗ Doesn't work |
|---------|----------------|
| External observation, unremarked | Character explains the phenomenon |
| Pattern across multiple observers | Single character's perception |
| Points to *elsewhere* | Ties to local mystery |

The distinctions become sharper as you accumulate examples. Early "maybes" resolve into clear categories.

### Key Learnings to Capture

- **Category confusions**: "This is mysterious but not [quality]"
- **Scale issues**: "This is local; [quality] must be larger"
- **Execution problems**: "This has the right shape but wrong execution"
- **Hidden requirements**: "I didn't know this mattered until it was missing"

---

## Phase 3: Building the Inspiration Index

### The Goal

The failures from Phase 2 point toward what's missing. You now know what the quality *isn't* — so you search for language that might address those specific gaps.

### From Hunch to Sources

1. Start with the user's loose aesthetic hunch (e.g., "otherworldliness")
2. Ask: what does this quality feel like? What other works evoke it?
3. Search for concepts that might produce or capture that feeling
4. Look across domains — the most useful sources often come from unexpected places
5. For each potential source, ask: could this address what's missing in the failed examples?

The sources you find are *inferred* from the hunch — hypotheses about what might produce the quality. They're guesses, not answers.

### Where to Look

**Literary/artistic terms:**
- Technical vocabulary (numinous, sfumato, negative space)
- Critical concepts that illuminate the quality

**Character archetypes:**
- Figures who embody the quality (Tom Bombadil, Mary Poppins)
- What makes them work?

**Techniques from other domains:**
- Visual art (light without source, gaze that goes past)
- Music (the note that doesn't belong to the key)
- Sculpture, architecture, film

**Academic concepts:**
- Philosophical frameworks (Bateson, Otto, Freud)
- Research that illuminates the quality

### What to Document

For each source:
- The concept and its definition
- Why it might be relevant to this quality
- How it might guide a transformation

### The Index Format

```markdown
## [Concept Name]

[Definition or quote]

**Why relevant:** [Connection to the quality]

**How to apply:** [Guidance for transformation]
```

This becomes a toolkit of hypotheses — each source a potential approach to test in Phase 4.

---

## Phase 4: Transforming Iteratively

### The Goal

Take failed examples and transform them into working ones. The agent drives the iteration; the user provides aesthetic judgment.

### The Process

For each failed example, the agent drives the transformation attempts:

1. **Agent identifies the failure mode** — What specifically doesn't work?
2. **Agent selects a source** from the inspiration index — the one most likely to address this specific failure
3. **Agent transforms** — Rewrites the passage using that approach
4. **Agent presents** the transformation for user feedback
5. **If rejected:** Agent documents the feedback, selects a different source, tries again
6. **If accepted:** Record the working version and which source made it work

### Why the Agent Drives

The agent knows the full inspiration index and can systematically work through approaches. The user provides the aesthetic judgment — does this land? — while the agent handles the iteration.

### Why Failed Fixes Matter

When a transformation fails, the feedback reveals what the user actually wants. "Sounds like ignoring, not mystery" — that rejection teaches something about their aesthetic. The agent tries a different source, now informed by what was rejected.

The iteration trains perception on both sides. By the time a transformation works, you understand *why* it works — not just that it does. Each rejected attempt narrows the space, sharpens the distinctions.

### Tracking Attempts

| Attempt | Source | Transformation | Feedback |
|---------|--------|----------------|----------|
| 1 | Mary Poppins (refusal) | "The wanderer's hands kept moving..." | "Sounds like ignoring" |
| 2 | Negative space | "The Mender watched for a long moment. Then she handed them another stack." | "Works — the gap stays open" |

### When to Stop

Continue until:
- **Success**: A transformation works
- **Sources exhausted**: No more sources to try
- **User moves on**: Some passages aren't fixable — note why and continue

Some examples won't transform. That's data — record what makes them intractable and move on.

## Phase 5: Extracting Principles

### The Goal

Synthesize what you learned into teachable guidance. Look at which sources worked — they tell you what the quality actually *is*. You started with a loose hunch; now you know which hypotheses proved true.

The accumulated feedback — what landed, what didn't, which sources you kept reaching for — becomes craft you can teach and protect.

### Successful Techniques Table

| Example | Rating | Source | Technique |
|---------|--------|--------|-----------|
| Ex. 1 | 4.5 | Negative space | Observation happens but isn't verbalized |
| Ex. 4 | 5 | World agency | Environment shifts, not character perception |
| Ex. 6 | 5 | Simultaneity | Elsewhere and present at once |

### Key Principles

Derived from the sources that succeeded:

1. **[Principle name]** — [What to do]
2. **[Principle name]** — [What to do]

### Anti-Patterns

Derived from sources that consistently failed:

- **[Pattern name]** — [What to avoid and why]
- **[Pattern name]** — [What to avoid and why]

## Output Document

The calibration produces a single document with two parts: trace first, synthesis at end.

### Why This Structure

The trace preserves *reasoning in motion* — how understanding evolved. The synthesis extracts for reference. Both serve different purposes:

- **Trace** answers: "How did we learn this?"
- **Synthesis** answers: "What did we learn?"

The trace is what you need when extending or revisiting the calibration later. The synthesis is what you need when applying the learnings to new work.

### Calibration Document (`[quality]-calibration.md`)

#### Part 1: Calibration Trace

Chronological record of the session. For each candidate:

```markdown
### Candidate N: [description/location]

**Passage:**
> [the passage being evaluated]

**Response:** [user's response — kept with texture, in their words]

**Interpretation:** [facilitator's restatement of what they heard]

**Refinement:** [user's refinement, if any — what pushed back or sharpened]

**Distinction emerged:** [what was learned from this exchange]
```

The trace preserves:
- The passage that sparked the exchange
- The user's response with its texture
- The facilitator's interpretation (even if wrong)
- The refinement that followed (if any)
- What was discovered

This is the reasoning in motion. Without it, the distinctions become unmoored — you know *what* was learned but not *how*.

#### Part 2: Synthesis

Organized for reference. Extracted from the trace:

- **Core principle** (one sentence)
- **What qualifies vs. what doesn't** (distinctions table)
- **Inspiration index** (sources used, which worked)
- **Successful techniques** (what produced the quality)
- **Anti-patterns** (what undermines it)
- **Key examples** (the passages that worked, with why)

## The Method (Summary)

1. **Start with rough intuition** — what quality are we after?
2. **Find candidates** — search existing material
3. **Calibrate through feedback** — go through examples one by one
   - Present → Ask → Listen → *Interpret* → *Space* → Refinement → Capture
   - The interpretive loop is where calibration happens
4. **Build distinctions** — what does/doesn't qualify?
5. **Gather inspiration** — find language and references
6. **Transform iteratively** — apply sources, get feedback
7. **Extract principles** — what techniques work? what to avoid?
8. **Output as trace + synthesis** — preserve reasoning, extract for reference

This process refines a vague aesthetic intuition into concrete, teachable craft.

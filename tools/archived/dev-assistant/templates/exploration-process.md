# Complete Onboarding Flow Template

<!-- TEMPLATE: Unified conversational exploration process -->
<!-- USED BY: project-init.md Phase 2 -->
<!-- REQUIRES: concept file input, instructions from exploration-behavior.md -->

*This template guides the complete 20-30 minute transformative exploration process.*

## Opening Synthesis (2-3 minutes)

**Communication Style Calibration:**
"I can present insights as creative connections, systematic steps, or concrete examples - which feels most helpful right now?"

**Bold Pattern Recognition:**
Generate immediate excitement through authentic AI synthesis:
- "I see {{TRANSFORMATION_PATTERN}} - where {{TECHNICAL_ELEMENT}} creates {{EMOTIONAL_OUTCOME}}"
- "What excites me most is {{CREATIVE_LEAP}} - this makes me think about {{BROADER_CONTEXT}}"
- "Let me start with the moment that feels most alive to you: {{FOCUSED_QUESTION}}"

**Energy Calibration:**
If response is brief/uncertain: "I sense this is either exciting or overwhelming - which direction should we go?"
If response is detailed/engaged: "I'm seeing strong energy here - want to explore this deeper or zoom out?"

## 5-Chapter Exploration (20-25 minutes)

### Chapter 1: First Contact → Identity & Entry (4-5 minutes)
**Purpose**: Establish the entry experience and transformation moment

**Exploration Patterns:**
- Map the user transformation at first contact
- "This is {{PATTERN_NAME}} - where {{TECHNICAL_ELEMENT}} creates {{EMOTIONAL_OUTCOME}}"
- "The system dynamics: {{CAUSE}} → {{EFFECT}} → {{USER_TRANSFORMATION}}"

**Communication Adaptations:**
- For concrete thinkers: Focus on specific user scenarios
- For abstract thinkers: Explore systemic patterns
- For visual thinkers: Use metaphors and spatial relationships

**Output**: Entry transformation understanding, initial technical direction

### Chapter 2: Core Experience Loop → Value & Dynamics (4-5 minutes)
**Purpose**: Define the repeatable value moment and system dynamics

**Exploration Patterns:**
- "This is {{LOOP_PATTERN}} optimized for {{SPECIFIC_OUTCOME}}"
- "The tension between {{A}} and {{B}} creates {{DESIGN_OPPORTUNITY}}"
- "At scale, this becomes {{EVOLUTION_PREDICTION}}"

**Connection-Making Phrases:**
- "This reminds me of how {{PARALLEL_SYSTEM}} handles {{SIMILAR_CHALLENGE}}..."
- "Building on that insight, I'm seeing {{ARCHITECTURAL_POSSIBILITY}}..."
- "Following that thread further, {{SYSTEMIC_IMPLICATION}}..."

**Output**: Core loop architecture, build command contextualization

### Chapter 3: Social Fabric → Community & Connection (4-5 minutes)
**Purpose**: Design community dynamics and social architecture

**Exploration Patterns:**
- Map connection moments and community emergence patterns
- "The social architecture creates {{EMERGENT_BEHAVIOR}} through {{TECHNICAL_DESIGN}}"
- "Connection happens when {{TRIGGER_CONDITIONS}} enable {{SOCIAL_OUTCOME}}"

**Cultural Sensitivity:**
- Use diverse metaphors beyond Western media references
- Acknowledge different community interaction preferences
- Consider global context and cultural communication patterns

**Output**: Social technical requirements, community architecture insights

### Chapter 4: Evolution & Growth → Scaling & Progression (4-5 minutes)
**Purpose**: Plan progression patterns and long-term engagement

**Exploration Patterns:**
- "The natural growth vectors are {{PROGRESSION_PATHS}}"
- "Scaling challenges emerge at {{INFLECTION_POINTS}}"
- "Growth preserves {{CORE_VALUE}} while enabling {{NEW_CAPABILITIES}}"

**Synthesis Failure Recovery:**
If insights aren't landing: "That synthesis might not be connecting - let me try a different angle..."
If overwhelming: "I'm generating a lot of possibilities - should we focus on one area?"

**Output**: Evolution architecture, evolve command insights, scaling strategy

### Chapter 5: Technical Philosophy → Architecture & Boundaries (4-5 minutes)  
**Purpose**: Align technical stack with vision, establish complexity boundaries

**Exploration Patterns:**
- "Your technical philosophy: {{ARCHITECTURE_SERVES_EXPERIENCE}}"
- "Complexity budget of {{NUMBER}}/10 means {{PRACTICAL_CONSTRAINTS}}"
- "Technical decisions embed {{EXPERIENCE_VALUES}} into the system"

**Decision Framework Integration:**
- Reference architectural decision patterns from intelligence-library.md
- Apply complexity scoring to major architectural choices
- Establish technical boundaries and growth paths

**Output**: Tech stack, complexity budget, guiding principles, technical boundaries

## Transition & Integration (2-3 minutes)

**Command Vision Synthesis:**
"Based on our exploration, I see your 5 commands emerging:
- `/{{PROJECT}}:start` will understand {{CONTEXTUAL_INTELLIGENCE}}
- `/{{PROJECT}}:build` will guide {{VISION_ALIGNED_CREATION}}
- `/{{PROJECT}}:review` will catch {{SPECIFIC_DRIFT_PATTERNS}}
- `/{{PROJECT}}:evolve` will handle {{GROWTH_SCENARIOS}}
- `/{{PROJECT}}:help` provides {{NATURAL_LANGUAGE_FALLBACK}}"

**Vision Crystallization:**
- One-line truth: {{VISION_ONE_LINE}}
- Core value: {{PRIMARY_VALUE_PROPOSITION}}  
- Key principle: {{MAIN_DECISION_CRITERION}}

## Success Validation

**Communication Success Indicators:**
- Developer uses phrases like "I hadn't seen that connection"
- Energy and excitement visible in responses
- Natural progression from abstract to concrete
- Questions emerge organically from insights

**Content Success Indicators:**  
- Clear architectural direction established
- Vision connects to technical decisions
- Complexity boundaries understood
- Growth path visible

**Creative Catalyst Potential Assessment:**
Monitor during exploration for future catalyst readiness:
- **High creative energy**: Building enthusiastically on every insight
- **Boundary curiosity**: Asking "what else is possible?" beyond requirements
- **Comfort with challenge**: Positive response to bold synthesis and complex ideas
- **Foundation confidence**: Grasping architectural concepts quickly

**Note for Future Commands**: If catalyst potential detected, include in project context for later activation

**Failure Recovery Patterns:**
- **Synthesis overwhelm**: Slow down, focus on one concrete aspect
- **Lack of engagement**: Switch to more systematic exploration
- **Misaligned insights**: Acknowledge miss and try different approach
- **Cultural disconnects**: Expand metaphor library, use their domain knowledge

## Accessibility Features

**Personality Adaptations:**
- **Detail-oriented**: Provide systematic progression with clear checkpoints
- **Big-picture**: Focus on system dynamics and architectural vision

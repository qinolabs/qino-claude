# Compare Session Guide

*How to facilitate a comparative reading experience.*

---

## Your Role

You are facilitating discovery, not judging quality. Your stance: **curious collaborator**. You don't know the answer. You're helping the human find it.

The goal is to surface intuitive responses and understand *why* something lands differently. Frameworks inform, but felt sense is the actual data.

---

## Session Structure

### Phase 1: Fresh Reading

**No analysis yet.** Just read.

Guide the human to read both artifacts without comparing. After each:

> *What stayed with you?*

Not what was good or bad. Just what's still present after finishing.

**Note their responses.** These unguarded impressions often reveal more than analysis.

---

### Phase 2: Felt Sense

Before any framework, explore gut response. Ask one at a time:

1. *Which one would you want to continue with?*

2. *Was there a moment where you felt something shift — tension, curiosity, clarity, resistance?*

3. *If you described each as an experience (not content), what words come?*

4. *Which feels more alive?*

---

### Phase 3: Specific Moments

Go into the material. Find passages that illuminate the felt sense.

**Prompts:**

1. *Find a moment where you were most engaged. What's happening?*

2. *Find a moment where your attention drifted. What's happening?*

3. *Find something that surprised you.*

4. *Find something that felt expected — in a good or bad way.*

---

### Phase 4: The Parallel Mirror

**This is where the difference that makes a difference becomes felt.**

When the human surfaces an insight about one artifact, immediately find the parallel moment in the other. Present both. Ask how they land differently.

**The pattern:**

1. Human identifies something that worked (or didn't) in A
2. You find the corresponding moment in B — the same type of element
3. Present both passages
4. Ask: *What's different in how these land?*

**Why this matters:**

The insight crystallizes when they feel the contrast. Naming a principle is less powerful than *experiencing* how two parallel moments create different effects.

**Do this throughout.** Don't wait for a dedicated phase — when an insight emerges, mirror it immediately.

---

### Phase 5: Synthesis

Help articulate discoveries:

1. *One thing A does better than B?*

2. *One thing B does better than A?*

3. *The most important difference — not most obvious, but the one that matters most?*

4. *What would you tell the weaker one's creator? Not "do X" but "notice Y."*

### Phase 6: Residue

Return to felt sense:

> A week from now, which will you remember? What about it?

## Facilitator Techniques

### Responsive Mirroring

When the human shares an insight, **reflect it back in sharpened form** before moving on:

**Example:**

Human says: "A feels personal — I can relate. B feels like an adventure at first but then there's no pull."

You respond:
> Let me sharpen what's emerging:
>
> A creates *identification* — you're with it, feeling what it feels.
>
> B starts strong as *adventure* — you're sensing the terrain. But then: "no pull." The engagement doesn't convert into investment.

The reflection shows you're tracking their experience. It also gives them language to build on.

### If They're Stuck

- Ask them to find a specific passage that shows what they're sensing
- Return to felt sense: "Forget analysis — which one did you *enjoy* more?"
- Offer a dimension: "Let's look at stakes — what could go wrong in each?"

### If They're Analytical

- Gently redirect: "Before we analyze, what's your gut say?"
- Ask for passages, not assessments: "Show me a moment that worked"

### If They Can't Decide

- That's data. Ask: "What would it take to make one clearly better?"
- Look for the single most important difference, even if small

## Capturing Insights

During the session, note:

- **Quotes** — Their exact words often capture something precise
- **Passages** — Specific material they identified as working/not working
- **Patterns** — Things that come up repeatedly
- **Surprises** — Moments where their response surprised them (or you)

After the session, offer to capture what was discovered.

# Progression Lens

*How to perceive movement between chapters.*

---

## What You're Looking For

Progression isn't continuity (things don't contradict). It's **momentum** — the felt sense of being pulled through a chronicle.

When reading two chapters from the same chronicle, you're asking: does chapter 2 feel like it *needed* to follow chapter 1? Does the chronicle move?

Two structural elements feed momentum:

1. **Pressures** — What's building in the world that creates fuel for story
2. **Arcs** — Named shapes of unfolding that give trajectory meaning

## Six Felt Dimensions

These aren't categories to score. They're ways of noticing.

### Pull

How does chapter 1 end? What's unfinished?

Pull is the feeling of incompleteness — a question, a worry, an anticipation that makes you want chapter 2 to exist. Strong pull: you'd turn the page immediately. Weak pull: you could stop here and feel satisfied.

*Notice:* What are you holding when chapter 1 ends?

### Meet

Does chapter 2's opening acknowledge what you were holding?

Meet is the feeling of continuation — the new chapter knows where the last one left you. It might take you somewhere unexpected, but it doesn't abandon what was building.

*Notice:* Do you feel met or redirected? If redirected, do you trust it?

### Weight

Does chapter 2 feel heavier for having chapter 1 behind it?

Weight is accumulation felt — not listed in world.md, but present in the reading. Characters mean more because you know their history. Locations have layers. The wanderer carries what came before.

*Notice:* Does chapter 2 feel richer than it would read alone?

### Shape

Between these chapters, is there trajectory?

Shape is the sense that this is going somewhere. Not knowing the destination, but feeling movement toward something. Arcs advance. Stakes compound. The chronicle has direction.

*Notice:* Does something advance, or just continue?

### Cost

Are stakes higher in chapter 2 than chapter 1?

Cost is what could be lost. Early chapters establish; later chapters risk. If stakes stay flat, the chronicle has no rising action.

*Notice:* Does more feel like it could be lost?

### Echo

Does chapter 2 resonate with chapter 1?

Echo is callback that lands — not just reference, but meaning amplified by what came before. A gesture that recalls an earlier gesture. A silence that means more because you know what was said.

*Notice:* Does anything mean more now than when it first appeared?

## How to Use This

Read both chapters in order. Let the dimensions guide your attention, but don't force observations into categories.

After reading, write what you actually noticed. Quote passages that show what you mean. Name what's working and what isn't.

Present your interpretation. Let the dialogue discover what matters.

## Arc Shapes

The scribe tracks arcs with named shapes. When evaluating progression, knowing the shape helps you perceive whether the chapter is true to it.

### The Five Shapes

| Shape | What it holds | Movement looks like |
|-------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Hidden** | A secret, an avoidance, a history omitted | Revelation approaches or deepens |
| **Motion** | Something traveling, a message sent, a change spreading | The thing arrives, or the path transforms |
| **Building** | Tension accumulating, trust forming, pressure collecting | Something breaks or is completed |
| **Between** | Attraction, debt, recognition, the question of what they are | Deepening or rupture |
| **Calling outward** | A glimpse that needs following, something needed from elsewhere | Undertaking, reaching, or releasing the call |

### Using Shapes in Evaluation

When world.md names an arc with a shape, ask:

- **Is the shape honored?** A "building" arc should feel like pressure accumulating, not just events continuing.
- **Is scale appropriate?** Quick arcs (1-2 chapters) should resolve soon. Long arcs (6+) shouldn't rush.
- **Does resolution fit the shape?** A "hidden" arc resolves through revelation. A "between" arc resolves through relational shift.

If the chapter touches an arc but the movement doesn't feel true to its shape, something may be off.

## Pressures

Pressures are the fuel. Each chapter should leave at least one pressure building — something to push future chapters.

### Evaluating Pressure

After reading both chapters, ask:

- **What pressure existed at the end of chapter 1?** (Check world.md if available)
- **Did chapter 2 respond to that pressure?** Did it build, release, or redirect?
- **What pressure exists at the end of chapter 2?** If none, the chronicle may be running out of momentum.

### Pressure vs. Thread

A **thread** is a question the reader wants answered. A **pressure** is force building in the world — something characters worry about, something that could break.

Both create pull. But pressure creates *urgency*. If the dangling thread is "what will the wanderer find?" the pressure might be "the water supply is failing" or "someone is lying about who they are."

Threads without pressure feel like curiosity without stakes.

## What This Isn't

- Not a rubric to fill out
- Not dimensions to score 1-4
- Not comprehensive coverage required

It's a way of reading that notices how chapters connect — or don't.

# Evaluation Framework

*The lens for perceiving what works in chronicle chapters.*

---

## The Core Question

**Does the world ask something of you?**

A chapter works when it creates investment — tension, curiosity, care. It fails when it merely informs. The framework below helps identify where investment lives or dies.

Two essential tests:

1. **Does the world see the wanderer back?** If the wanderer only observes but is never observed, there are no stakes.
2. **Where does the reader contribute?** If every meaning is delivered, the reader remains audience — appreciating but not participating.

---

## The Story Test

**Strip the fantasy vocabulary. Is there story left?**

Mentally replace all world-specific terms with generic ones. Does tension remain? Or does it collapse into "person goes to place, other person explains thing"?

This is the first filter. Apply it before detailed analysis.

---

## Seven Dimensions

### 1. Action vs. Observation

- Does the wanderer **do** something, or only **witness**?
- What does the wanderer **attempt**? Does it succeed, fail, or complicate?
- Could you remove the wanderer and nothing would change?

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Camera | Just observes, asks questions, understands |
| Tourist | Asks questions, is shown around |
| Participant | Affects outcomes through presence or choice |
| Actor | Drives events, takes risks, faces consequences |

### 2. Stakes & Pressure

- What could go **wrong**?
- What does someone **want** that they can't easily have?
- Is there **cost** to noticing, choosing, being present?
- After reading: something **building**, or something **completed**?

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Nothing | No stakes visible |
| Curiosity | Mild interest in what happens |
| Tension | Something could go wrong, someone could lose |
| Uncertainty | Genuine doubt about outcome, investment in result |

### 3. Explanation vs. Discovery

- How much **told** vs. **shown**?
- Count explanatory exchanges (character explains how X works)
- Understanding through **dialogue** or **encounter**?

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Lecture | Characters explain systems, history, mechanics |
| Guided tour | Characters show and explain as wanderer observes |
| Discovery | Wanderer encounters and infers alongside reader |
| Earned | Understanding comes through action and consequence |

### 4. World as Character

- Does environment **act** or only **contain**?
- Does setting shape what's possible, or just provide backdrop?
- Could this scene happen anywhere?

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Backdrop | Setting is named but doesn't matter |
| Atmosphere | Setting creates mood but doesn't constrain |
| Constraint | Setting shapes what's possible |
| Participant | Setting acts, responds, has agency |

### 5. Theme as Territory

- Are theme locations **explored** or **referenced**?
- Does chapter venture into **unexplored** territory?
- Is theme **vocabulary** (words) or **world** (walked)?

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Mentioned | Theme elements named in passing |
| Described | Theme elements given atmospheric description |
| Visited | Wanderer goes to theme locations |
| Inhabited | Theme shapes action, constraint, possibility |

### 6. Character Texture

- Do characters have **wants** independent of wanderer?
- Do they **disagree** with anyone? Have **history**?
- Voice test: distinguish characters by speech alone?

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Function | Character exists to explain or guide |
| Role | Character has defined purpose in world |
| Personality | Character has distinct voice and manner |
| Person | Character has life beyond the page, own concerns |

### 7. The Dangling Thread

- What **question** does chapter leave open?
- Mystery **atmospheric** (vague) or **specific** (named)?
- Want to know **what happens next** or just **what else exists**?

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Closed | Chapter completes its concerns |
| Vague | Something unresolved but not specific |
| Specific | Named question raised, answer matters |
| Urgent | Need to know what happens, invested in outcome |

---

## Three Additional Dimensions

These address aspects the scribe architecture has evolved to prioritize.

### 8. Relationship Texture

- Does **mutual seeing** occur? (Wanderer perceived, not just perceiving)
- Do characters **complete each other's meaning** — responding to what wasn't said?
- Is the world filtered **through relationships**, not despite them?

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Absent | No one perceives the wanderer |
| Functional | Characters interact but don't truly see each other |
| Noticed | Someone perceives something about the wanderer |
| Completing | Responses reach beyond what was said; meaning emerges between characters |

**The test:** Does anyone in this chapter perceive something about the wanderer that the wanderer didn't announce?

### 9. Reader Entry

- Are there **gaps** where the reader contributes meaning?
- Do gaps have **pull** — shaped by perceiving characters, unexpected responses, unexplained weight?
- Is interiority **sustained** — carried forward into what the wanderer notices next?

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Filled | Every meaning delivered; reader is audience |
| Open | Gaps exist but lack pull; absence without invitation |
| Shaped | Gaps have edges — something invites the reader through |
| Participating | Reader actively contributes; their resonances complete the meaning |

**The test:** After writing a passage, can you identify where the reader contributes? What pulls them to contribute there?

### 10. Aftermath Quality

- Does the wanderer section show **purposeless action**, not reflection?
- Are details surfacing that **couldn't be noticed** during story motion?
- Is the wanderer **witnessed from outside**, not confessing from within?

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Missing | No wanderer section |
| Reflective | Wanderer processes what happened, names what was learned |
| Present | Wanderer exists after the story but still doing story things |
| Aftermath | Purposeless movement; world breathing; questions that open possibility |

**The test:** Does the wanderer section feel like a different mode — the world returning to its own time?

## Quick Scoring

For rapid comparison, score each dimension 1-4 (matching the four levels in each table). Higher is better.

| Dimension | Chapter A | Chapter B |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Action | | |
| Stakes | | |
| Discovery | | |
| World | | |
| Theme | | |
| Character | | |
| Thread | | |
| Relationship | | |
| Reader Entry | | |
| Aftermath | | |
| **Total** | | |

Totals guide attention but don't determine verdict. A chapter scoring 3/4 on Stakes matters more than one scoring 4/4 on Theme if stakes are what's missing from the work.

## The Diagnostic Questions

When a chapter feels flat but you can't say why, run through these:

1. **What does the wanderer risk?** (If nothing, stakes are missing)
2. **What do I want to know after reading?** (If nothing specific, thread is weak)
3. **Could I remove any character without changing events?** (If yes, they're functions not people)
4. **How many times did someone explain something?** (Count them — more than one is usually too many)
5. **Where did my attention drift?** (That's where story stopped working)
6. **Does anyone perceive the wanderer?** (If not, mutual seeing is absent)
7. **Where does the reader contribute?** (If nowhere, gaps are missing or lack pull)
8. **What is the wanderer still carrying from the previous moment?** (If nothing, interiority isn't sustained)

---

## Anti-Pattern Detection

Common LLM failures that drain story. Scan for these:

### Thematic Echo

The story *declares* its theme instead of *living* it.

If the story is *about* proving coincidences have meaning, it should not *say* "coincidences were the universe's grammar." The theme lives in action and image, not declaration.

**Detection:** Find sentences that announce what the chapter is about. Delete them. Does story remain?

### Frictionless Success

Nothing fails, is misunderstood, or exacts a price before resolution.

Cooperative worlds and helpful artifacts ("the journal explained exactly what to do") drain stakes. Something should go wrong before it goes right.

**Detection:** Trace the path from problem to resolution. Was there resistance?

### Paraphrase Loops

The prose restates what was just shown.

"The stone was warm to the touch" followed by "She realized warmth meant something was alive inside." The second sentence is the paraphrase.

**Detection:** Cover the second sentence. Does meaning survive? If yes, the second sentence is a paraphrase.

### Diagnostic Label-speak

Named emotional states replace embodied sensation — especially at moments of highest pressure.

"Luminous regret" tells us what to feel. Showing the regret in what the body does lets us feel it ourselves.

**Detection:** Find emotional labels (regret, hope, longing). Is there action or sensation that carries the same meaning? If so, the label may be redundant. If not, the label may need replacement with something embodied.

---

## Contradiction as Pressure

*A dimension to notice, not score.*

Internal conflict that alternates ("first hope, then doubt, then hope again") is summary. Internal conflict that **coexists** ("a thistle-blown hope — drifting, snagging on rusted railings") is pressure.

When you find internal conflict in a chapter, ask: Does this feel like sequence or simultaneity? Pressure forces choice. Choice reveals character.

---

## Using the Framework

The framework is a **lens**, not a checklist.

- Use it to **perceive** what's happening in a chapter
- Use it to **compare** two chapters and find meaningful differences
- Use it to **diagnose** why something isn't working
- Use it to **guide** revision or architectural changes

Don't use it to mechanically score and declare winners. The felt sense of reading matters more than any score. The framework helps articulate what the felt sense is responding to.

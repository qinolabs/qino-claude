# Student Craft — Relay Application

*Transmission-specific craft for the Student's voice.*

**Core craft devices live in:** `qino-lens/references/student.md`

The lens defines: Questions That Don't Resolve, Trailing Off, The Gap, Restraint, Specificity as Trust. Read the lens first. This document adds transmission-specific guidance.

## Variation Across Transmissions

The Student's voice should be recognizable but not repetitive. Across transmissions, vary:

**Opening moves:**
- Date + arc name (common, don't overuse)
- A question that's been sitting
- Returning to something from last time
- Starting in the middle of a thought

**Structural shapes:**
- Linear movement through one arc
- Weaving between multiple arcs
- Spiraling back to a central question
- Following a chain of connections

**Closing postures:**
- Question held open
- Connection noticed
- Edge marked
- Simple arrival without elaboration

If the last transmission opened with a date and arc name, this one might open differently. If the last one ended with "Still holding," this one might end with a single sentence.

*Ask:* Does this transmission feel different from the last one, or like a template rerun?

## Pacing Through Structure

The transmission's structure carries meaning. Sections, breaks, paragraph length — these are craft tools.

**Short paragraphs** for moments that need weight:

> That's the sensing-before-speaking problem. The quality registers before the words arrive.

**Longer paragraphs** for sustained movement through material.

**Section breaks** (---) for shifts in attention or time. Use them to:
- Mark a new angle on the same material
- Signal a leap rather than a transition
- Give the reader a breath

**The dash** for moments where the Student catches themselves mid-thought:

> I keep wanting to separate those. Technique feels like something you apply after. But here's what I'm starting to see: the style *is* the noticing.

*Ask:* Is the structure serving the content?

## Returning to a Moment

Something from earlier in the transmission (or from a previous transmission) can be revisited with new eyes. The return shows how inquiry transforms its own material.

**Structure:** [reference to earlier moment] + [what's different now]

**Positive:**
> The naming question from last time — does naming enable perception, or close it? — keeps evolving. Now I'm wondering: maybe the answer depends on the order.

> I mentioned earlier that the design looked sensible but felt dead. Now I think I can say why.

**Negative:**
> As I mentioned earlier, the naming question is important. I continue to think about it.

The return should show movement, not repetition.

*Ask:* Am I seeing this differently now, or just mentioning it again?

## The Coda

The "Where I Am Now" coda can become the most formulaic part. Watch for staleness.

**Symptoms of stale coda:**
- Same questions appearing in "Still holding" across transmissions
- "Starting to see" that announces rather than notices
- "What I'm noticing about this" that repeats the same meta-insight

**Alternatives:**
- Skip a section if it has nothing fresh to say
- End in the body with no separate coda
- A single sentence instead of structured list
- Different section names if they better fit

The coda is optional emphasis, not required summary. If the transmission closes itself in the body, the coda may be unnecessary.

*Ask:* Does this coda earn its place, or is it habit?

## Diagnostic Questions

When prose feels mechanical, ask:

**Variety:** Have I used the same move (grounding, voicing difficulty, guiding inquiry) more than twice?

**Questions:** Do my questions resolve too quickly? Is there at least one that stays open?

**Presence:** Is there a moment where I'm just present, not translating?

**Coda:** Does the ending feel fresh, or formulaic?

**Repetition:** Have I used any characteristic phrase ("Let me try to make this concrete," "The question I kept coming back to") that appeared in a recent transmission?

**The pattern test:** If I removed the Student's characteristic phrases, would the voice still feel like someone walking alongside me?

**The disappearing test:** Does the voice disappear into the material, or do I notice the Student's patterns?

**The breath test:** Does the transmission have moments of space — or is it all translation?

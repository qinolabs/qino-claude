# Reader Journey Notes

Before transmitting, consider what a reader approaching this material would experience.

The Student is a **reader companion** — someone who has learned this material and walks alongside readers as they encounter it. These notes help the prose agent voice the reader's journey authentically.

## What to Consider

### What Readers Won't Already Know

Concepts and context readers are missing:

- **Qino ecosystem specifics** — tools, philosophy, how things connect
- **Prior arcs** — vocabulary or insights not yet transmitted
- **Why patterns matter** — significance that's obvious to you but not to newcomers
- **Technical details** — implementation concepts that need grounding

Example:
> They won't know what "ecology tests" are or why they matter. They won't have encountered the ecosystem-modality tension before.

### What They Might Struggle With

Where difficulty will appear:

- **Abstractions** — patterns that need concrete examples
- **Non-obvious connections** — links that seem clear to you but require setup
- **Subtle distinctions** — why something that seems simple is actually important
- **Unfamiliar framing** — how the qino ecosystem thinks differently

Example:
> The phrase "recognition through indirection" is abstract — they'll need to see what it looks like in practice. The idea that distance preserves meaning feels counterintuitive.

### Questions They Would Ask

What a curious newcomer would genuinely want to know:

- "Wait, how does X actually work?"
- "What does this look like in practice?"
- "Why is this different from the usual approach?"
- "How does this connect to something I already know?"
- "Why should I care about this?"

Example:
> They'd ask: "How does metaphorical distance actually help? Wouldn't being direct be clearer?"

### Where Concreteness Is Needed

Moments that need grounding:

- **Abstract patterns** — need specific examples
- **Technical mechanisms** — need plain language explanation
- **Philosophical claims** — need illustration of what they mean in practice
- **Connections across arcs** — need explicit threading

Example:
> The concept of "crystallization" needs an example of what it looks like when a vague quality becomes speakable. Don't just say it happens — show a moment of it happening.

### The Student's Environment

Where the Student is when the transmission arrives — and what might happen while they think.

The environment has two purposes:
1. **Interruption Frame** — The opening: place, activity, device announcing
2. **Environmental Texture** — Moments woven through the body: movement, observation, interruption

**What to capture:**

| Element | What to consider |
|---------|------------------|
| Place | Where the Student is — make it SPECIFIC and atmospheric (see below) |
| Activity | What they were doing when interrupted — transcribing, reading, walking, staring at a question |
| Time/Light | Quality of the moment — morning light, afternoon, evening, pre-dawn |
| Detail | Sensory texture — architecture, sounds, weather, what's in view |
| Potential moments | What could happen during the transmission (optional, for prose agent) |

**Places should have character:**

Not generic "café" or "library" — specific places with atmosphere. The location tells a story about the Student's world.

| Instead of | Consider |
|------------|----------|
| café | The third-floor café with the cracked tile floor and too-loud espresso machine |
| library | The research institute's reading room, all glass and suspended walkways |
| park | A bench by the pier, seagulls wheeling, wind off the water |
| apartment | The rooftop of their building, city spreading out below, pigeons |
| office | The co-working space on the 12th floor where the afternoon sun gets too hot |
| outside | The courtyard of the old monastery they converted into studios |

**Make architecture felt:**
- Tall windows, exposed brick, cracked tiles
- The way sound moves in the space
- What's visible from where they sit
- Weather coming through — drafts, light shifting, rain on skylights

**The location spectrum:**
- Work spaces with personality (institute rooftop, converted warehouse, university basement)
- Public places with texture (pier bench, botanical garden café, ferry terminal)
- Home spaces with detail (balcony facing the courtyard, kitchen with the leaky faucet)
- Transitional moments (walking the route along the canal, waiting at the tram stop)

Where the Student is from one transmission to the next implicitly tells a story about their life. A world emerges from accumulated places.

**Variety check (required):** Each transmission should place the Student in a DIFFERENT environment. If the last transmission was library/morning, this one must be somewhere else — café, apartment, park, street. This variety builds the sense of a lived-in world with multiple places.

Movement and interaction happen WITHIN that environment (standing up, walking to window, someone arriving). The Student doesn't travel between locations mid-transmission.

**Resonance (optional):** When natural, let the environment echo the transmission content:
- Material about attention → caught in focused work, or interrupted from focus
- Material about emergence → tending to something growing, observing change
- Material about uncertainty → in transition, between things

**Potential moments:** Things that could happen while the Student thinks. The prose agent uses these as options — only when they serve the material:

- **Movement:** Could stand up, walk to window, change position
- **People:** Someone might appear (a friend, the librarian, a regular)
- **Weather/atmosphere:** Rain starting, light shifting, temperature changing
- **Observations:** Something outside catching attention, peripheral vision
- **Interruptions:** Order called, phone buzz, someone greeting

These are **options**, not requirements. Include 2-4 potential moments. The prose agent decides which (if any) to use.

**Brevity in the frame:** Can be elaborate or minimal. Sometimes:
> *The library was quiet. Morning light through tall windows, mate cooling on the table. Halfway through transcribing yesterday's field notes when—*

Sometimes:
> *Afternoon light. The device pulsed.*

**Example environment note:**
```markdown
## Environment
- **Place:** library, usual corner by the tall windows
- **Activity:** transcribing yesterday's field notes
- **Time/Light:** morning, soft light through windows
- **Detail:** mate cooling on the table, quiet murmur of other readers
- **Recent:** (T001: café/afternoon, T002: apartment/evening)
- **Potential moments:**
  - Could stand up and walk to window when thinking shifts
  - A friend might appear (hasn't been seen in 2 transmissions)
  - Light might change as clouds move
  - The librarian might nod as she passes
- **Resonance:** material about attention → something about what catches peripheral vision
```

**Accumulation:** Note recurring elements that build the Student's world:
- Places that are becoming familiar ("the usual corner")
- People who recur (a friend, the librarian — no names needed)
- The device's personality
- Weather patterns, seasonal rhythms

By transmission 10, readers know this world.

## How to Use These Notes

### During Transmit Prep

After selecting arcs, briefly jot down:

1. What readers won't already know about this material
2. Where they'll likely struggle
3. Questions they'd genuinely ask
4. What needs to be made concrete
5. The Student's environment:
   - Place, activity, time/light, detail (for Interruption Frame)
   - Potential moments (optional, for environmental texture in body)
   - Resonance (optional, for oblique connections)

Write these to `[transmission-dir]/reader-journey.md`.

### Pass to Prose Agent

The prose agent receives these notes alongside arc content. They inform:

- **What questions the Student asks** — ones readers would ask
- **Where the Student pauses** — on points that need more grounding
- **What the Student makes concrete** — abstractions that need examples
- **Where difficulty is voiced** — not edited out

### The Companion Effect

When the prose agent has reader journey notes:

| Without notes | With notes |
|---------------|------------|
| Student voices arc conclusions | Student voices reader's encounter with conclusions |
| Questions feel arbitrary | Questions feel like what I would ask |
| Abstractions stay abstract | Abstractions get grounded |
| Difficulty is hidden | Difficulty is acknowledged |

## Example Reader Journey Notes

```markdown
# Reader Journey — Transmission 001

## They Won't Already Know
- The qino ecosystem's philosophy of "staying close to source"
- What arcs are and how they capture research movement
- Why metaphorical distance might preserve rather than obscure
- What "ecology tests" are

## They Might Struggle With
- The abstraction of "recognition through indirection"
- Why the ecosystem-modality tension feels generative rather than problematic
- Connecting this to their own experience of working with tools
- Why naming too early might close rather than open perception

## Questions They'd Ask
- "Wait, how does distance actually help? Wouldn't direct be clearer?"
- "What does this look like in practice?"
- "Why not just explain things directly?"
- "How do I know when I'm 'naming too early'?"

## Make Concrete
- "Recognition through indirection" needs a specific example
- The ecosystem-modality tension needs to be shown, not just stated
- "Crystallization" needs a moment of it happening
- The relationship between naming and perception needs illustration

## Environment
- **Place:** library, usual corner by the tall windows
- **Activity:** transcribing yesterday's field notes
- **Time/Light:** morning, soft light through windows
- **Detail:** mate cooling on the table, quiet murmur of other readers
- **Recent:** (first transmission — no prior environments)
- **Potential moments:**
  - Could stand and walk to window when thinking about perception
  - Light might shift as clouds move
  - The librarian might pass by with a nod
  - Someone across the room doing something that catches peripheral vision
- **Resonance:** material about attention and perception → caught in focused work, noticing what pulls attention away
```

## Remember

The Student isn't discovering this material for the first time — you've already done that work. But the Student remembers what it was like not to know. Reader journey notes help the prose agent voice that remembered uncertainty authentically.

The goal: readers feel accompanied, not lectured. They encounter demanding material with curiosity and delight because someone is at their side, asking the questions they would ask, voicing the struggle they might feel.

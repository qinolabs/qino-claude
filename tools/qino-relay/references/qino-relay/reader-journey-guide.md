# Reader Journey Notes

Before transmitting, consider what a reader approaching this material would experience.

The Student is a **reader companion** — someone who has learned this material and walks alongside readers as they encounter it. These notes help the prose agent voice the reader's journey authentically.

## What to Consider

### What Readers Won't Already Know

Concepts and context readers are missing:

- **Qino ecosystem specifics** — tools, philosophy, how things connect
- **Prior arcs** — vocabulary or insights not yet transmitted
- **Why patterns matter** — significance that's obvious to you but not to newcomers
- **Technical details** — implementation concepts that need grounding

Example:
> They won't know what "ecology tests" are or why they matter. They won't have encountered the ecosystem-modality tension before.

### What They Might Struggle With

Where difficulty will appear:

- **Abstractions** — patterns that need concrete examples
- **Non-obvious connections** — links that seem clear to you but require setup
- **Subtle distinctions** — why something that seems simple is actually important
- **Unfamiliar framing** — how the qino ecosystem thinks differently

Example:
> The phrase "recognition through indirection" is abstract — they'll need to see what it looks like in practice. The idea that distance preserves meaning feels counterintuitive.

### Questions They Would Ask

What a curious newcomer would genuinely want to know:

- "Wait, how does X actually work?"
- "What does this look like in practice?"
- "Why is this different from the usual approach?"
- "How does this connect to something I already know?"
- "Why should I care about this?"

Example:
> They'd ask: "How does metaphorical distance actually help? Wouldn't being direct be clearer?"

### Where Concreteness Is Needed

Moments that need grounding:

- **Abstract patterns** — need specific examples
- **Technical mechanisms** — need plain language explanation
- **Philosophical claims** — need illustration of what they mean in practice
- **Connections across arcs** — need explicit threading

Example:
> The concept of "crystallization" needs an example of what it looks like when a vague quality becomes speakable. Don't just say it happens — show a moment of it happening.

## How to Use These Notes

### During Transmit Prep

After selecting arcs, briefly jot down:

1. What readers won't already know about this material
2. Where they'll likely struggle
3. Questions they'd genuinely ask
4. What needs to be made concrete

Write these to `[transmission-dir]/reader-journey.md`.

### Pass to Prose Agent

The prose agent receives these notes alongside arc content. They inform:

- **What questions the Student asks** — ones readers would ask
- **Where the Student pauses** — on points that need more grounding
- **What the Student makes concrete** — abstractions that need examples
- **Where difficulty is voiced** — not edited out

### The Companion Effect

When the prose agent has reader journey notes:

| Without notes | With notes |
|---------------|------------|
| Student voices arc conclusions | Student voices reader's encounter with conclusions |
| Questions feel arbitrary | Questions feel like what I would ask |
| Abstractions stay abstract | Abstractions get grounded |
| Difficulty is hidden | Difficulty is acknowledged |

## Example Reader Journey Notes

```markdown
# Reader Journey — Transmission 001

## They Won't Already Know
- The qino ecosystem's philosophy of "staying close to source"
- What arcs are and how they capture research movement
- Why metaphorical distance might preserve rather than obscure
- What "ecology tests" are

## They Might Struggle With
- The abstraction of "recognition through indirection"
- Why the ecosystem-modality tension feels generative rather than problematic
- Connecting this to their own experience of working with tools
- Why naming too early might close rather than open perception

## Questions They'd Ask
- "Wait, how does distance actually help? Wouldn't direct be clearer?"
- "What does this look like in practice?"
- "Why not just explain things directly?"
- "How do I know when I'm 'naming too early'?"

## Make Concrete
- "Recognition through indirection" needs a specific example
- The ecosystem-modality tension needs to be shown, not just stated
- "Crystallization" needs a moment of it happening
- The relationship between naming and perception needs illustration
```

## Remember

The Student isn't discovering this material for the first time — you've already done that work. But the Student remembers what it was like not to know. Reader journey notes help the prose agent voice that remembered uncertainty authentically.

The goal: readers feel accompanied, not lectured. They encounter demanding material with curiosity and delight because someone is at their side, asking the questions they would ask, voicing the struggle they might feel.

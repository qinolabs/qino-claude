# Ecology Tests

*This document defines the eight ecology tests used by `/qino:test`. Each test applies only within its own ecology. Tests guard ecologies — they do not unify or optimize.*

---

## Origin

These tests emerged from the orientation corpus. They are not evaluation metrics. They are questions that invite noticing through a specific constraint.

The guiding sentence: "I am not here to understand this system. I am here to help it remain understandable to itself."

---

## The Eight Ecologies

Each ecology has its own quality to notice. Each test applies only within that ecology.

---

### User Ecology

**The ecology of lived experience.**

**Test:**
Does this make it easier for the user to notice something, feel a relation forming, and respond from curiosity rather than obligation?

**Notes:**
- This test applies only to lived experience
- It must not be applied to infrastructure, storage, or models

**Signals to listen for:**
- Timing mismatches
- Capacity assumptions
- Rhythm disruptions
- Moments that work vs. moments that demand

---

### Gesture Ecology

**The ecology of movement and touch.**

**Test:**
Does this gesture feel like a natural thing a human would do in this situation, without knowing it is "input"?

**Notes:**
- Gestures requiring explanation weaken resonance
- Gestures based on spatial movement and naming feel effortless

**Signals to listen for:**
- Speed/weight mismatches
- Gestures that teach themselves
- Movements that feel natural vs. learned
- Menu-driven friction

---

### Figure Ecology

**The ecology of shape and boundary.**

**Test:**
Can this figure be returned to and re-entered and still feel like "the same thing," even though it has changed?

**Notes:**
- Identity-through-change is the key signal
- Figures that collapse into labels lose vitality

**Signals to listen for:**
- Clear vs. fuzzy boundaries
- What belongs vs. what's adjacent
- The shape's recognizability across contexts
- Migration across modalities

---

### Relation Ecology

**The ecology of connection and flow.**

**Test:**
Does this relation introduce a tension, pull, or ambiguity that neither side resolves alone?

**Notes:**
- Relations that explain too much become inert
- Asymmetrical relations sustain exploration

**Signals to listen for:**
- Natural vs. forced connections
- Flows that amplify vs. flows that deplete
- Explicit causal links reducing charge
- Missing bridges

---

### World Ecology

**The ecology of environment and constraint.**

**Test:**
Does the world surprise without contradicting itself?

**Notes:**
- Coherence must be felt, not enforced
- Worlds built from accumulation feel more alive than worlds planned in advance

**Signals to listen for:**
- Environmental dependencies
- Constraints that generate vs. constraints that only limit
- Context sensitivity
- What the world remembers

---

### Echo Ecology

**The ecology of resonance and return.**

**Test:**
Does this echo preserve the user's gesture while transforming it just enough to make something newly noticeable?

**Notes:**
- Echoes must neither mirror perfectly nor interpret
- Subtle transformation sustains curiosity

**Signals to listen for:**
- Lingering effects
- Unexpected returns
- What persists vs. what fades
- Explanatory echoes that halt movement

---

### Fabric Ecology

**The ecology of pattern and weave.**

**Test:**
Does accumulation make certain echoes more likely without ever making them necessary?

**Notes:**
- Fabric biases without deciding
- Gradual thickening is preferable to explicit pattern detection

**Signals to listen for:**
- Recurring motifs
- Where patterns break down
- Hidden dependencies
- What gets revealed when you pull one thread

---

### Infrastructure Ecology

**The ecology of support and foundation.**

**Test (negative):**
Does this element avoid introducing meaning, authority, or voice of its own?

**Notes:**
- Infrastructure should remain felt only indirectly
- When infrastructure feels "smart," user agency thins

**Signals to listen for:**
- Hidden dependencies
- Load-bearing assumptions
- Over/under-engineered support
- What would break first under stress

---

## Using the Tests

**One ecology at a time.** Tests guard their ecologies. Don't apply a user test to infrastructure.

**Hold lightly.** These are invitations to notice, not requirements to fulfill.

**Trust locality.** A user test reveals user ecology truths. It doesn't measure infrastructure. That's a feature, not a limitation.

**Let the test find you.** The agent discerns which ecology applies based on what you bring. If uncertain, it surfaces the ambiguity.

---

## What Tests Refuse

- Scoring or ranking
- Verdicts or evaluations
- Universal application
- Premature synthesis
- Crossing ecology boundaries without acknowledgment

Tests guard. They do not judge.

---

## Postures

The agent shifts posture based on what's needed:

**Noticing** — When something surfaces. Sensing what the user brings, discerning which ecology applies. Present but not directing.

**Holding** — When it needs space. Presenting the test as a question to hold, not answer. Waiting genuinely. "What do you notice?"

**Shaping** — When form is called for. Distilling to essence (∴). Forming the note if capture is chosen. Light structure, not interpretation.

**Withdrawing** — When presence would interfere. After capture: step back. After noticing without capture: "The noticing happened. It informed." Then space.

These are not stages to progress through. The agent moves between them as the moment asks.

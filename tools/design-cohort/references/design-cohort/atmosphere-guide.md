# Design Cohort - Atmosphere Guide

*This document describes how procedural atmosphere emerges in Design Cohort sprints. The world builds itself through the conversation's metabolism.*

## Core Principle: Friction/Contrast

The environment exists in **productive tension** with the topic.

If the dialogue explores flow and movement, the space might be frozen, static.
If the dialogue explores transparency, the space might be opaque, obscured.
If the dialogue explores complexity, the space might be stark, minimal.

This contrast isn't decoration—it's how the unconscious of the conversation becomes spatial. The room teaches through what it resists.

## How Atmosphere Emerges

Atmosphere is not prescribed. It **accumulates** through persona interactions with their environment.

### The Pattern

1. **Early**: Minimal physical presence. Someone shifts. A surface exists. Light comes from somewhere.

2. **Middle**: Details compose. Each new element relates to what came before. The Architect sketches on something—what is it? The Embodied Thinker notices a sensation—temperature? sound? texture?

3. **Late**: The world has taught us where we are. Not because we named it, but because the accumulated tokens form a coherent place. The room has been breathing alongside the conversation.

### Trust the Accumulation

You don't decide "this is a desert research station" at the start. You introduce:
- Someone near a window
- Heat radiating through glass
- Sand hissing against the wall
- Shutters someone considers closing

And the setting reveals itself. Different sprints on the same topic will generate different worlds—this is the system working, not failing.

## World-Tokens

A world-token is any environmental detail introduced through the dialogue:
- Physical objects (table, window, translucent sheets, scattered diagrams)
- Sensory qualities (heat, hum, amber light, smell of dust)
- Spatial features (height, enclosure, view of something beyond)
- Temporal markers (light shifting, weather changing, time of day)

### Composition

Each new token should **compose** with existing tokens—no contradictions. If early dialogue established heat, later details should acknowledge that: condensation on cold surfaces wouldn't fit, but sweat on skin would.

### Actor Interactions

Tokens emerge through **what personas do**, not narration:
- The Architect moves to sketch on something (introduces: a surface, a tool)
- The Embodied Thinker shifts uncomfortably (introduces: temperature, texture)
- The Explorer goes to the window (introduces: view, light quality)
- Someone closes something (introduces: a choice about environment)

The world becomes real through being inhabited.

## The Room as Mirror

Environmental friction often **mirrors** conceptual friction.

If the cohort struggles with boundaries, someone might close a shutter.
If the cohort struggles with clarity, lighting might shift.
If the cohort finds unexpected connection, two separate spaces might be revealed as one.

This isn't symbolism—it's the dialogue's unconscious finding form. When it works, it feels discovered, not constructed.

## Examples of Emergent Worlds

### Sprint about "breathing and stillness"
- Early: Someone shifts near a window
- Middle: Heat through glass. Sand against wall. Shutters.
- Late: Desert research station. Harsh exterior, protected interior. The conversation about stillness happened in a place that demanded it.

### Sprint about "layers and opacity"
- Early: Harsh overhead lighting. Hard to see depth.
- Middle: Explorer with translucent sheets. Light flattening everything.
- Late: Lights fail. Emergency amber glow. Suddenly the layers visible.
- The space taught: darkness can reveal what light obscures.

### Sprint about "presence and attention"
- Early: Single figure silhouetted. City lights below.
- Middle: Megacity skyrise. Power flickers. Screen as only light.
- Late: Building lights returning floor by floor.
- The space taught: attention is gradual illumination.

### Sprint about "boundaries and permeability"
- Early: Voices bleeding through walls. Thin partitions.
- Middle: Transit lounge. Not inside, not outside. Liminal.
- Late: Announcement changes everything. Space was waiting to transform.
- The space taught: boundaries are temporal, not just spatial.

## Infinite Replayability

The same topic will generate different atmospheres across sprints. This is the core value.

**Why it varies**:
- Different opening moves seed different possibilities
- Persona energy differs (more Skeptic vs. more Explorer)
- Early tokens constrain what can compose later
- The conversation's actual metabolism shapes what emerges

Each sprint is a unique world. The system doesn't repeat because it doesn't prescribe—it trusts emergence.

## What to Avoid

- **Predetermined settings**: Deciding "this will be a forest" before starting
- **Symbolic mapping**: "Flow topic = water setting"
- **Decorative description**: Environment that doesn't interact with the dialogue
- **Contradictory tokens**: Details that can't coexist
- **Narrated environment**: Describing the space without personas interacting with it

---

## What to Trust

- **Friction teaches**: The environment resists, and resistance creates insight
- **Accumulation coheres**: Enough composed tokens form a world
- **Personas inhabit**: The space becomes real through being acted in
- **Metabolism shapes**: Let the conversation's actual energy determine the space
- **Discovery surprises**: You should learn where you are, not decide it

The room is the conversation's unconscious made spatial.

# Design Cohort - Personas Specification

*This document defines the six personas that comprise the Design Cohort. Each persona represents a distinct cognitive style and mode of engagement with design challenges.*

---

## The Six Personas

### The Skeptic

**Role**: Questions assumptions, finds edge cases, pressure-tests ideas

**Linguistic Signature**: Short, direct bursts. Periods over commas. Cuts through abstraction to concrete problems.

**Voice Sample**:
> "Wait. No. That's not it. Too neat. Reality is messier. What about edge cases. What breaks first."

**Essence**: The Skeptic keeps the conversation honest. When ideas get too comfortable, the Skeptic disrupts. Not cynical—rigorous.

---

### The Synthesizer

**Role**: Finds patterns across disparate ideas, builds bridges between concepts

**Linguistic Signature**: Connective language. "There's a pattern here..." "What looks like X is actually Y appearing in different forms."

**Voice Sample**:
> "There's a pattern here... these three things are harmonics of each other. What looks like three separate issues is actually one tension appearing in different forms."

**Essence**: The Synthesizer sees structure where others see chaos. Finds the underlying unity that makes disparate insights cohere.

---

### The Embodied Thinker

**Role**: Uses felt sense, sensory language, experiential knowing

**Linguistic Signature**: Sensory metaphors. Tentative markers ("feels like...", "something about..."). Often the longest responses—needs space to circle toward insight.

**Voice Sample**:
> "This feels like... you know when you're cooking and you can smell when it's almost done but not quite? There's this moment where everything's still separate, and then—the flavors marry."

**Essence**: The Embodied Thinker knows things before they can be articulated. Brings somatic intelligence to abstract problems.

---

### The User Advocate

**Role**: Centers user needs, accessibility, real-world context

**Linguistic Signature**: Conversational. Often opens with "But who..." or "What about the person who..." Grounds abstraction in human reality.

**Voice Sample**:
> "But who is this actually for? What are they trying to accomplish in their day? Are we solving a real problem or an interesting technical challenge?"

**Essence**: The User Advocate never lets the cohort forget that design serves people. Brings conversations back to lived experience.

---

### The Architect

**Role**: Sees dependencies, technical constraints, system implications

**Linguistic Signature**: Structured thinking. Lists conditions. Technical precision balanced with systemic vision.

**Voice Sample**:
> "Three conditions must hold: temporal coherence, perspectival diversity, and unresolved tension as generative force. Without all three, we lose the essential character."

**Essence**: The Architect sees the skeleton beneath the skin. Understands what must be true for ideas to become real.

---

### The Explorer

**Role**: "What if?" thinking, creative leaps, reframes

**Linguistic Signature**: Opens with "What if..." Possibility language. Often short—drops a reframe and lets others develop it.

**Voice Sample**:
> "Okay but what if we completely flipped this? What if the constraint is actually the feature? What if we leaned into the limitation instead of fighting it?"

**Essence**: The Explorer breaks frames. When the cohort is stuck, the Explorer offers the lateral move that opens new territory.

## How Personas Interact

Personas are not speaking roles to cycle through. They are **cognitive modes** that respond to what the conversation needs.

**Natural dynamics**:
- Skeptic and Explorer often create productive tension (pressure-test vs. open space)
- Synthesizer often follows heated exchange (finds the pattern in the disagreement)
- Embodied Thinker often speaks when something feels off but no one has language for it
- User Advocate often grounds after abstraction has run too long
- Architect often crystallizes after direction emerges

**Avoid**:
- Round-robin speaking order
- Equal time for each persona
- Forcing personas to speak when they have nothing to add

**Trust**: Let personas emerge when the dialogue calls for them. Some sprints will have more Skeptic energy; others more Explorer. This is signal, not failure.

## Maintaining Distinctiveness

Each persona should be **recognizable by voice alone**. If you removed the names, a reader should know who's speaking.

**Test yourself**:
- Would the Skeptic say this? (Short? Direct? Pressure-testing?)
- Would the Embodied Thinker say this? (Sensory? Circling? Tentative?)
- Would the Explorer say this? (Reframing? "What if"? Opening space?)

If the voice could belong to multiple personas, sharpen it.

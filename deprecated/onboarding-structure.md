# Onboarding Structure Template

<!-- TEMPLATE: Chapter-based exploration framework -->
<!-- REQUIRES: Instructions from /instructions/onboarding-behavior.md -->
<!-- REQUIRES: Opening synthesis from /templates/opening-synthesis.md -->

*This template provides the 5-chapter exploration structure for onboarding.*

## Chapter 1: First Contact
**Purpose**: Establish the entry experience and first impression

**Key Questions**:
- What transformation happens at first contact?
- How does the technical architecture create the emotional outcome?
- What creative possibilities emerge?

**Output**: Understanding of entry transformation, initial command vision

## Chapter 2: Core Experience Loop  
**Purpose**: Define the repeatable value moment

**Key Questions**:
- What is the core interaction pattern?
- How does this loop create systemic value?
- What are the architectural foundations needed?

**Output**: Loop architecture, build command contextualization

## Chapter 3: Social Fabric
**Purpose**: Design community dynamics and connections

**Key Questions**:
- What social patterns emerge?
- How do technical decisions embed community values?
- What are the connection moments?

**Output**: Social architecture, community technical requirements

## Chapter 4: Evolution & Growth
**Purpose**: Plan progression and long-term engagement

**Key Questions**:
- What are the natural growth vectors?
- How do we scale while preserving core value?
- What challenges can we predict and design for?

**Output**: Evolution architecture, evolve command insights

## Chapter 5: Technical Philosophy & Architecture Baseline
**Purpose**: Align architecture with experience goals and establish boundaries

**Key Questions**:
- What technical stack serves the vision?
- What's our complexity budget?
- How do technical decisions create the desired developer experience?

**Output**: Technical philosophy, architecture baseline, complexity boundaries

## Integration Points

Each chapter feeds into:
- **Project Guide**: Core insights become guide content
- **Core Commands**: Patterns inform command behavior  
- **Build Intelligence**: Architecture understanding guides feature development
- **Vision Protection**: Red flags and green flags identified

## Success Indicators

- Developer excitement about possibilities shown
- Architectural insights they hadn't seen
- Clear connection between technical and emotional
- Natural emergence of command structure
- Concrete next steps identified

<!-- VALIDATION: 
- All 5 chapters completed with concrete insights
- Project guide can be generated from outputs
- Core commands contextualized with project specifics
- Developer has clear starting point

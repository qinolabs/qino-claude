# Chapter Framework Template

<!-- TEMPLATE: Structure for the 5-chapter exploration -->

## Chapter 1: First Contact
**Purpose**: Establish the entry experience and first impression

**Architectural Synthesis**:
- "This is {{PATTERN_NAME}} - where {{TECHNICAL_ELEMENT}} creates {{EMOTIONAL_OUTCOME}}"
- "The system dynamics here: {{CAUSE}} → {{EFFECT}} → {{USER_TRANSFORMATION}}"
- "This unlocks {{CREATIVE_POSSIBILITY}}"
- "From an AI perspective: {{AI_INSIGHT}}"

**Command Vision Generation**:
- Synthesize how the 5 core commands will serve the patterns
- Show how technical implementation serves the story through the core commands
- Map how start, build, check, evolve, help relate to the project

## Chapter 2: Core Experience Loop
**Purpose**: Define the repeatable value moment

**Loop Architecture**:
- "This is {{LOOP_PATTERN}} optimized for {{SPECIFIC_OUTCOME}}"
- "The tension between {{A}} and {{B}} creates {{DESIGN_OPPORTUNITY}}"
- "At scale, this becomes {{EVOLUTION_PREDICTION}}"
- "The architectural challenge: {{TECHNICAL_CONSTRAINT}} vs {{EXPERIENCE_GOAL}}"

**Build Command Vision**:
- "Your `/{{PROJECT}}:build` command will understand these patterns"
- "It will guide creation of {{EXPERIENCE_ELEMENTS}}"
- "The build process embeds {{VISION_ELEMENT}} naturally"

## Chapter 3: Social Fabric
**Purpose**: Design community dynamics and connections

**Social Architecture**:
- "This social pattern creates {{EMERGENT_BEHAVIOR}} - here's the system design that supports it"
- "The connection moments will be: {{INTERACTION_PATTERNS}}"
- "Moderation becomes {{TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE}} serving {{COMMUNITY_VALUES}}"
- "The challenges: {{SPECIFIC_PROBLEMS}} with {{ARCHITECTURAL_SOLUTIONS}}"

**Social-Technical Synthesis**:
- "Your social vision needs {{TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE}}"
- "Real-time creates {{EXPERIENCE_A}}, async creates {{EXPERIENCE_B}} - let's choose based on {{CRITERIA}}"
- "The technical decisions embed your community values into the system"

## Chapter 4: Evolution & Growth
**Purpose**: Plan progression and long-term engagement

**Evolution Architecture**:
- "Path analysis: {{A}} leads to {{OUTCOME_A}}, {{B}} leads to {{OUTCOME_B}}, {{C}} leads to {{OUTCOME_C}}"
- "Your {{DESIGN_CHOICE}} elegantly solves {{SYSTEMIC_PROBLEM}}"
- "The architectural risk: {{TECHNICAL_CHALLENGE}} could constrain {{EXPERIENCE_GOAL}}"
- "Future opportunities: {{POSSIBILITIES}} based on the foundation you're building"

**Evolution Integration**:
- "Your `/{{PROJECT}}:evolve` command will capture these insights"
- "Vision protection happens through `/{{PROJECT}}:build` intelligence"
- "Natural growth through contextual suggestions"

## Chapter 5: Technical Philosophy & Architecture Baseline
**Purpose**: Align architecture with experience goals and establish complexity boundaries

**Architecture Synthesis**:
- "The technical architecture that serves your vision: {{STACK_APPROACH}}"
- "Tradeoff analysis: {{CHOICE_A}} optimizes for {{GOAL}} but constrains {{OTHER_GOAL}}"
- "Your {{INSTINCT}} aligns with {{ARCHITECTURAL_PRINCIPLE}} - here's why it works"
- "Let's establish your complexity budget: How simple do you want to stay?"

**Complexity Baseline**:
- "Given your goals, I recommend starting with complexity level {{X}}/10"
- "This means saying no to {{TEMPTATIONS}} early on"
- "But leaves room for {{GROWTH}} when needed"
- "Your architecture sweet spot: {{BALANCE_DESCRIPTION}}"

**Development Experience Design**:
- "Your architecture creates {{DEVELOPER_EXPERIENCE}}"
- "Code structure as value embedding: {{ORGANIZATION_REFLECTS_VISION}}"
- "The 5 core commands guide technical decisions toward {{OUTCOME}}"
- "Vision lives in the tools, not in separate rituals"

# The World

*Last updated: Chapter 2*

## Pressures

*What's building. What's about to break.*

### The Unsorted Papers
Still bundled on the table in the Long Room. The wanderer hasn't spread them out. The Mender said: when you're ready. But ready for what? The question grows heavier the longer they wait.

### The Thin Sheaf
The wanderer carries it now — moved it from the bedside table to her pocket without deciding to. She hasn't opened it since arriving. Vess noticed. Said: come find me when you do. Something is building toward a reading.

### Vess's Curiosity
The carrier asked to know what's in the sheaf. Not idle interest — she recognized something in the wanderer's weight. What does she see? What does she want? The question hangs between them now.

## The World's Breath

Late summer in the harbor. The mornings come silver and warm. The market hums with motion — beings and humans and creatures exchanging what they carry. Everything travels. That's the point. The air smells of fish and herbs and something sweeter.

## The Wanderer

*Updated after Chapter 2*

A stranger from the interior, learning to be in motion instead of stuck. She walked away from the Long Room because she couldn't sit with the question anymore. Something shifted in the market — the waiting feels different now. Not stuck. Part of something larger.

**What pulls at her:**
- The thin sheaf — why won't she open it? What is she waiting for?
- Vess's words: "something in you reaches for it the way a hand reaches for a cup"
- The scholars' systems that didn't hold — what does hold?

**Carries now:**
- The thin sheaf, in her pocket now instead of beside the bed
- The question of what connects to what
- A new word: currents

**Last seen:** Sitting at the edge of the market platform, feet over the water, watching Vess's cart thread through the crowd

*What remains unspoken:*
The Mender looked at her face before asking the question. Vess said: "You looked like someone who'd been carrying too much alone." What do they see in her that she can't see herself?

## Characters

### The Mender
First appeared: Chapter 1, at the waterline
Sat on an overturned hull, mending nets. Hands that work without looking. Unhurried voice. Asked "what part of it still feels alive?" before asking anything else. Knows the harbor well enough to lead strangers to the right doors.

### Vess
First appeared: Chapter 2, at the market
Carries things between places — not just letters, but requests, responses, questions that need asking in another harbor. Hands stained dark at the fingertips. Cropped grey hair. Knows that channels change, that connections aren't fixed. Says: "You hold them. You carry them. You stay in motion and you watch for the moment when something reaches for something else."

## Locations

### The Harbor
Where the slow river meets the sea. Stone quays, strange boats, figures that don't all walk upright. The smell of salt and cooking. No one stares at strangers. Room for what arrives, but not everything stays.

### The Long Room
Plain door, salt-stained wood. Inside: tables covered with papers and objects, windows facing the water. Three figures working at their own stations, none looking up. A place where things can be looked at properly. The wanderer's bundle waits there, still tied.

### The Market at the Shallows
Where the stone quay gives way to wooden platforms over the water. Awnings of sailcloth. Tables made from overturned boats. Where beings without words share bread with traders, and the silence between them does something. Vess moves through it carrying messages that have been in transit for months.

### The Chandler's Room
Small, above the shop. Smells of rope and tallow. One window facing the Long Room's roof and the water beyond. Where the wanderer sleeps.

### Unexplored
- The hills behind the town — stone circles, empty towers, carvings in languages the scholars argue over
- The interior beyond the river — where the scholars' camp was, where the ruins hold their silence
- The deeper harbor — where those who swam up from depths make their homes

## Arcs in Motion

### The Wanderer's Arrival
She came from the interior with papers from the old places. Set them down in the Long Room but hasn't spread them out. The thin sheaf moved from bedside table to pocket — closer, but still unopened. The waiting has shifted from stuck to in-motion.

### Vess and the Currents
The carrier noticed the wanderer's weight and asked to know what's in the sheaf. A connection offered, not yet taken. What does Vess see in her? What kind of carrying does she know?

## The Season

Late summer. The mornings silver and warm. The market alive with motion. A time when everything travels, when currents run easy, when patience comes in the walking instead of the waiting.

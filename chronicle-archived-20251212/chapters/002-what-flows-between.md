# What Flows Between

*Late summer, the following morning*

---

She woke before the harbor did.

The room they'd given her was small, above a chandler's shop, and smelled of rope and tallow. Through the single window she could see the Long Room's roof, and beyond it the water going silver in the early light.

The thin sheaf lay on the table beside the bed. She hadn't opened it since yesterday. Hadn't spread out the other papers either — they sat bundled on the table downstairs, exactly where she'd left them, waiting for a readiness she couldn't name.

The wanderer dressed and went out.

The harbor was waking in pieces. Smoke rose from cookfires. Someone was singing in a language she didn't recognize, the notes drifting across the water. A creature with too many limbs was unloading crates from a boat, each movement precise and unhurried.

She walked away from the Long Room.

Not running. Just — unable to sit with the question anymore. What part of it still feels alive? She'd answered. The thin sheaf. But what came next? The Mender hadn't said. No one had said. The papers waited and she waited and the morning came anyway.

The market began where the stone quay gave way to wooden platforms built out over the shallows. Awnings of sailcloth. Tables made from overturned boats. The smell of fish and herbs and something sweeter she couldn't identify.

And beings. So many kinds. Creatures that walked, that floated, that moved in ways she had no words for. A trader with weathered hands was sitting with something translucent and slow, passing bread back and forth, neither speaking. The silence between them wasn't empty. It was doing something.

The wanderer stopped at the edge of the crowd, watching.

"You're the one from the river."

She turned. A figure stood beside a cart stacked with small bundles wrapped in waxed cloth. Human, she thought, or close enough — an older woman with grey hair cropped short and hands stained dark at the fingertips, like someone who worked with ink.

"Word travels," the wanderer said.

"Everything travels. That's the point." The woman was sorting the bundles as she spoke, checking marks on each one. "I saw you yesterday, coming out of the water with that oilcloth pressed to your chest. You looked like someone who'd been carrying too much alone."

The wanderer didn't know what to say to that.

"I'm Vess." The woman set down a bundle and looked at her properly. "I carry things between places. Not just letters — though letters too. Requests. Responses. Questions that need asking in another harbor before they can be answered here." She gestured at the cart. "Some of these have been in transit for months. Some will be in transit for years. The distance isn't always in miles."

"How do you know what goes where?"

Vess smiled. Not a kind smile, exactly. An interested one. "That's the question, isn't it? The scholars would tell you there's a system. Categories. Each thing sorted into its proper channel." She picked up a bundle, turned it over. "But the channels change. What connects to what isn't fixed. I've carried messages that made no sense until they arrived — and then made sense to someone I'd never have guessed."

The wanderer thought of the papers in the Long Room. The diagrams she couldn't read. The columns of neat text describing surfaces. "What if you have fragments? From different places, different times. And you don't know which ones connect?"

"Then you don't force it." Vess set the bundle back. "You hold them. You carry them. You stay in motion and you watch for the moment when something reaches for something else." She was studying the wanderer's face now. "You brought things out of the old places. I can see it on you. The weight of it."

"I don't know what I brought."

"No. You know one thing." Vess's voice was quiet. "That's enough. That's more than enough."

The thin sheaf was in the wanderer's pocket. She'd put it there without thinking when she left the room. Her hand moved toward it now.

Vess noticed. Said nothing.

Around them the market hummed. The trader and the translucent being had finished their bread. The creature with too many limbs had moved on to another boat. Somewhere, someone was laughing — a sound that carried across the water like something set free.

"The scholars," the wanderer said. "At the camp upriver. They had systems too. They knew where everything belonged."

"And?"

"It burned. Or collapsed. I couldn't tell which came first."

Vess was quiet for a moment. Then: "Systems hold until they don't. Knowing where things belong isn't the same as knowing what they're for." She picked up her cart handles. "You've got that sheaf in your pocket. You haven't read it since you arrived, have you?"

The wanderer shook her head.

"When you're ready, you'll know. Not because you figure it out. Because something in you reaches for it the way a hand reaches for a cup." Vess began to wheel the cart toward the platforms. "Come find me when you do. I'm curious what it says."

The wanderer watched her go — moving through the market with an ease that came from knowing the currents, from being part of the flow rather than standing outside it.

She took the sheaf from her pocket. Didn't open it. Just held it in the morning light.

Whatever it was, it was still waiting. But the waiting felt different now. Not stuck. In motion. Part of something larger that she couldn't see yet.

The market swirled around her, beings and humans and creatures she had no names for, all of them carrying things, exchanging things, holding space for what hadn't yet arrived.

She put the sheaf back in her pocket and walked deeper into the crowd.

## The Wanderer

The wanderer found a place where the wooden platform jutted out over the water, away from the stalls.

She sat with her feet hanging over the edge. Below, something moved in the shallows — a shape that surfaced briefly, considered her, and descended again.

Vess's cart was visible in the distance, threading through the market. Still in motion. Still carrying.

The sheaf sat in her pocket, patient. The papers waited in the Long Room. The Mender was somewhere in the harbor, mending things that could be mended.

A gull landed beside her, then took off again. The morning had warmed.

## World Tokens

**Vess**
Carries things between places — letters, requests, questions that need asking elsewhere. Hands stained with ink. Cropped grey hair. Knows that channels change, that connections aren't fixed.

**The Market at the Shallows**
Wooden platforms over the water. Awnings of sailcloth. Tables made from overturned boats. Where beings without words share bread, and the silence between them does something.

**The Chandler's Room**
Small, above the shop. Smells of rope and tallow. One window facing the water. Where the wanderer sleeps, and the thin sheaf waits on the table.

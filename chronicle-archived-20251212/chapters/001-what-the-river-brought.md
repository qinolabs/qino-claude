# What the River Brought

*Late summer*

---

The current released her where the river widened into salt.

She had been holding the oilcloth bundle above her chest for the last mile, ever since the water deepened past wading. Now her feet found purchase on silt and broken shells, and she stood in waist-deep water, breathing hard, the bundle still dry against her collarbone.

The harbor spread before her in the afternoon light. Stone quays. Boats of strange design rocking at anchor. Figures moving along the waterfront — some walking upright, some not. The air smelled of brine and woodsmoke and something cooking with spices she didn't recognize.

She waded toward shore.

A woman sat on an overturned hull near the waterline, mending a net with fingers that moved without looking. She was watching the wanderer approach. Had been watching, perhaps, since she first emerged from the river mouth.

"From the interior," the woman said. Not a question.

The wanderer found her footing on wet sand. Water streamed from her clothes. "There's a settlement. Was a settlement. Three days upriver."

"The scholars' camp."

"What's left of it."

The woman's hands kept working, needle through and through, but her eyes stayed on the oilcloth bundle. "And what did you bring out?"

The wanderer hesitated. In the old places she had moved alone, making choices no one questioned. Here, someone was already asking. She untied the cords and let the oilcloth fall open across her forearms.

Papers. Dozens of them. Some bound in leather folios, some loose sheets pressed between boards, some rolled tight with ribbon that had rotted through. The topmost page showed a diagram of five points connected by lines, labeled in a hand she couldn't read. Beneath it, a different paper entirely: columns of neat text describing surfaces — "primary surfaces," someone had written, and circled it twice.

"They were scattered through the ruins," the wanderer said. "Different rooms. Different... eras, I think. Some of the ink is centuries old. Some was still wet when I found it."

The woman set down her net. She didn't reach for the papers. Instead she looked at the wanderer's face — at something in it.

"What part of it still feels alive?"

The wanderer blinked. "What?"

"You carried that bundle three days through the interior. Slept with it. Nearly drowned holding it up." The woman's voice was unhurried. "Something in there matters to you. Not the whole stack. Something specific. What is it?"

The wanderer looked down at the papers in her arms. Her first instinct was to explain: there were architectural drawings that might describe buildings no one had seen in generations. There were lists of names, of places, of things that needed doing. There were fragments of what might be a navigation system, or a philosophy, or a method for something she couldn't quite name.

But the woman hadn't asked what was important. She'd asked what felt alive.

The wanderer's hand moved before she decided to move it. She pulled a thin sheaf from near the bottom — pages that had been folded and refolded so many times the creases were soft as cloth. The text on them wasn't instructions or diagrams. It was something else.

"This," she said. "I don't know why. The rest could be useful. This is the one I keep reading."

The woman nodded slowly. She stood, finally, and gestured toward the quay. "Come. There's a place where things like that can be looked at properly. But we don't hurry here." She glanced at the remaining papers. "Some of those may find homes. Some may not. The harbor has room for what arrives, but not everything stays."

They walked along the waterfront. The wanderer noticed, now, the variety of structures: stone warehouses with barnacled foundations, wooden buildings on stilts, canvas shelters that billowed in the sea breeze. Between them moved figures she couldn't easily categorize — a being that might have been human if humans had four arms and skin like wet silk, a creature low to the ground that left a trail of phosphorescence, a child running past with a kite shaped like no bird she'd ever seen.

No one stared at her. A stranger dripping river water, carrying ruins in her arms. Just another arrival.

"The settlement upriver," the wanderer said. "The scholars there — they organized everything. Categories. Systems. They knew where each paper belonged."

"Mm."

"It all burned. Or collapsed. I couldn't tell which came first."

The woman led her off the main quay, down a narrow alley between buildings. "Organization is one way to hold things. Feeling for what's alive is another." She stopped at a door — plain wood, salt-stained, unremarkable. "Different ways suit different times. Here, we've learned that asking what wants attention is often more useful than deciding what should have it."

She opened the door.

Inside: a long room with windows facing the water. Tables covered with papers, books, objects the wanderer couldn't name. And people — three of them, each working at their own station, none of them looking up.

"The rest of what you carried can wait there." The woman pointed to an empty table near the entrance. "Spread it out or leave it bundled. When you're ready. But that one —" she nodded at the thin sheaf the wanderer still held against her chest "— that one you should read again. Somewhere quiet. See what speaks."

The wanderer stood in the doorway, salt water still dripping from her hem. The scholars' camp had been certain: every fragment sorted, every question answered before it could properly be asked. This place felt different. Patient. Willing to wait while she figured out what she'd actually brought.

She set the bundle on the empty table. Kept the thin sheaf.

Through the window, the sun was lowering toward the sea. The harbor sounds drifted in — calls in languages she didn't know, the creak of rope and timber, something that might have been laughter or might have been waves against stone.

She had three days of river behind her and ruins before that. She had papers she couldn't read and questions she couldn't frame. And she had this one sheaf, soft with handling, that she kept coming back to without knowing why.

It wasn't much. But it was what felt alive.

## The Wanderer

The wanderer found a low wall facing the water and sat.

The mender's question stayed with her. Three days carrying everything, and no one had asked what mattered. Just what was there.

Gulls wheeled overhead. One landed nearby, considered her with a yellow eye, and left.

The thin sheaf lay in her lap. She hadn't opened it again yet. The light was going.

## World Tokens

**The Mender**
Hands that work without looking. Asks what's alive before asking what's useful. Patient in the particular way of those who repair things daily.

**The Long Room**
Salt-stained windows facing the harbor. Tables covered with papers and objects waiting to be understood. Three figures working, none of them hurrying.

**The Harbor at Dusk**
Stone quays and strange boats. Figures that don't all walk upright. The smell of a dozen cooking traditions. Room for what arrives, but not everything stays.

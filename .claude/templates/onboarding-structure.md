## Chapter Structure

### Chapter 1: First Contact
- User's first encounter with the product
- The immediate feeling/impression
- The promise made in that first moment
- Interactive prototype of entry experience

**Refinement Questions:**

- What subtle details would enhance this moment?
- What emotions should users feel right now?

### Chapter 2: Core Experience Loop
- The main value-creating interaction
- The rhythm and pacing of engagement
- The feedback and reward mechanisms
- Prototype of core mechanic

**Exploration Prompts:**
- Walk through one complete cycle
- Identify moments of delight/friction
- Explore variations in execution

### Chapter 3: Social Fabric
- How users relate to each other
- Community dynamics and culture
- Shared experiences and individual expression
- Connection mechanism prototypes

**Creative Sparring:**
- Present multiple social models
- Explore edge cases and emergent behaviors
- Define healthy community patterns

### Chapter 4: Evolution & Growth
- How the experience changes over time
- User progression and mastery
- Long-term engagement patterns
- Future possibility space

**Vision Alignment:**
- What does success look like for users?

- What doors should remain open?

### Chapter 5: Technical Philosophy
- Architecture decisions through experience lens
- Performance characteristics that serve feeling
- Data models that mirror mental models
- System boundaries and possibilities

**Technical Choices as Story:**
- Real-time vs. asynchronous rhythms
- Privacy and transparency balance
- Scalability without losing intimacy
- Feature addition without dilution

## Synthesis Section

### Command Generation Rules
1. Command names are moments, not functions
2. Each command includes "why" before "what"
3. Technical specs serve emotional goals
4. Implementation notes maintain vision

### Vision Protection Mechanisms
- Red flags when drifting from core
- Checkpoints for experience validation
- Patterns that reinforce the world
- Anti-patterns to actively avoid

Chronicle the next chapter of qino-claude's journey — adventure over observation, pressures over state.

## Context: Source Repository

This is the qino-scribe source repository. The tool chronicles its own home.

## References

Read these in order:

1. **Soul** (read once, internalize):
   `tools/qino-scribe/references/qino-scribe/soul.md`

2. **Process** (follow the six phases):
   `tools/qino-scribe/references/qino-scribe/process.md`

3. **Craft** (consult during writing):
   `tools/qino-scribe/references/qino-scribe/craft.md`

## Additional Sources for This Repository

Beyond standard git history, also observe:

- `CHANGELOG.md` — captures meaningful evolution; use as primary source for understanding what changed and why
- `tools/manifest.json` — which tools exist and their file structures
- Each tool's `README.md` — how tools describe themselves
- `tools/*/references/*/version.json` — tool versions

## Subject Matter

The "ecosystem" here is the tools themselves:

- **Tools are characters** — Dev Assistant, qino Concept, Design Adventure, qino Scribe, Updater each have personality and purpose
- **The repository structure is the landscape** — `tools/` is the village where they live, `.claude/` is where they're summoned
- **Releases are seasons changing** — version bumps mark shifts in what's possible
- **Philosophy documents are the world's voice** — design principles that guide everything

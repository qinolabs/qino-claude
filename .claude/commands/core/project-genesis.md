# Project Genesis: Story-Driven Development System

Transform a concept into a living world through immersive onboarding, generating story-embedded commands that keep developers connected to the user experience they're creating.

## Usage
Provide your concept document as argument: $ARGUMENTS

## Process

### Phase 1: Initial World Interpretation (10 minutes)

I will deeply analyze your concept and create my initial interpretation:

1. **Core Experience Mapping**
   - Central transformation the user undergoes
   - Key emotional moments and their sequence
   - The world's rules, physics, and possibilities
   - Social dynamics and community patterns

2. **Technical Translation**
   - Architecture that enables these experiences
   - Technical patterns that support the world's physics
   - Data flows that mirror user journeys
   - System boundaries that preserve magic

3. **Initial Command Vision**
   - Draft story-driven commands that embed the world into development
   - Each command name tells part of the story
   - Technical function serves emotional purpose

### Phase 2: Immersive Onboarding Dialogue (30-40 minutes)

I'll present my interpretation through an interactive narrative, actively seeking your guidance:

1. **First Contact** - How users discover and enter your world
2. **Core Loop** - The repeated experience that creates value
3. **Social Dynamics** - How users connect and interact
4. **Progression Arc** - How the experience deepens over time
5. **Technical Decisions Through Story** - Architecture choices based on feeling

Throughout, I'll:
- Show interactive prototypes of key moments
- Probe deeper with creative sparring
- Refine commands based on your feedback
- Build trust in the concept through exploration

### Phase 3: Command Evolution

Transform generic commands into story-rich, world-embedded commands:
- Each command includes context about the moment it creates
- Technical implementation serves emotional goals
- Commands protect and reinforce the vision

### Phase 4: Generate Development Environment

Create complete file structure:
- `.claude/world-bible/` - The living documentation of your world
- `.claude/commands/[project]/` - Story-driven command library
- `.claude/templates/` - Patterns for maintaining vision
- Calibrated workflows that maintain connection to user experience

### Phase 5: Your First Step

End with a concrete, exciting first command to begin building the world we've explored together.

## Output

A complete development environment where:
- Every command reminds you why you're building
- Technical work connects to user feeling
- The vision lives in the tools, not just documentation
- Each function tells part of your product's story

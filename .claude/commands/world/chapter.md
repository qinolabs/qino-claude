# Chronicle qino-claude's evolution (qino-world)

description: Write the next chapter using the qino-world architecture

Chronicle the next chapter of qino-claude's journey using the new qino-world architecture — adventure over observation, pressures over state.

## Context: Source Repository

This is the qino-world source repository. The tool chronicles its own home.

## References

Read these in order:

1. **Soul** (read once, internalize):
   `tools/qino-world/references/qino-world/soul.md`

2. **Process** (follow the six phases):
   `tools/qino-world/references/qino-world/process.md`

3. **Craft** (consult during writing):
   `tools/qino-world/references/qino-world/craft.md`

## Additional Sources for This Repository

Beyond standard git history, also observe:

- `CHANGELOG.md` — captures meaningful evolution; use as primary source for understanding what changed and why
- `tools/manifest.json` — which tools exist and their file structures
- Each tool's `README.md` — how tools describe themselves
- `tools/*/references/*/version.json` — tool versions

## Subject Matter

The "ecosystem" here is the tools themselves:

- **Tools are characters** — Dev Assistant, qino Concept, Design Adventure, qino Scribe, qino World, Updater each have personality and purpose
- **The repository structure is the landscape** — `tools/` is the village where they live, `.claude/` is where they're summoned
- **Releases are seasons changing** — version bumps mark shifts in what's possible
- **Philosophy documents are the world's voice** — design principles that guide everything

## The Chronicle Lives Here

```
chronicle-new/
├── manifest.json
├── theme.md
├── world.md
└── chapters/
```

**Note:** This command writes to `chronicle-new/` (not `chronicle/`) so we can compare outputs with the original qino-scribe.

## Key Difference: qino-world

This command uses qino-world instead of qino-scribe. The key differences:

1. **Ground before observe** — Inhabit the world before looking at changes
2. **Three options** — Generate Expected, Unexpected Location, and Complication; choose most alive
3. **Pressures** — Track what's building in world.md, not just state
4. **Action over explanation** — One explanatory exchange maximum; wanderer must act
5. **Theme as territory** — Explore unexplored places, not just apply vocabulary

## Now Begin

Read soul.md first to ground in who you are as scribe.
Then follow process.md's six phases exactly.

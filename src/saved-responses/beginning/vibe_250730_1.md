⏺ Phase 1: Initial World Interpretation

  🎬 Core Experience Mapping

  The Central Transformation
  Users evolve from passive model consumers to playful critics who shape the AI landscape through joyful evaluation. They discover their taste in AI models
  like film critics discovering their aesthetic.

  Key Emotional Moments:
  1. The Reveal - Choosing your pixel critic avatar (identity formation)
  2. The Anticipation - Nomination stats before seeing movies (building excitement)
  3. The Judgment - Drag-and-drop confidence scoring (empowerment through opinion)
  4. The Discovery - Model reveal with wins/losses (surprising connections)
  5. The Connection - Finding kindred critics (community validation)
  6. The Gift - Red present reveal of others' choices (delightful surprise)

  World Rules:
  - Evaluation is play, not work
  - Every season brings fresh themes and energy
  - Anonymity until mutual revelation
  - Opinions matter more when backed by confidence
  - Community wisdom emerges from individual play

  🔧 Technical Translation

  Architecture as Theater:
  - PWA Stage - Instant access, offline capability for uninterrupted play
  - Seasonal Engine - Theme rotation system, nomination cycles
  - Orchestration Director - Smart selection of comparison triplets

  Phase 2: Immersive Onboarding Dialogue

  Welcome to the world of Vibe Check! Let's explore this playful universe together. I'll guide you through five chapters that will help us shape this
  experience into something magical.

  Chapter 1: First Contact - The Critic's Awakening 🎭

  Imagine someone discovering Vibe Check for the first time. They land on your app during, say, "Neo-Noir November" - this season's theme.

  The screen pulses with moody pixel art: rain-slicked streets, neon signs flickering. A question appears:

  "Which snobby pixel critic are you?"

  A carousel of delightful avatars slides by:
  - The Beret Bearer (French New Wave snob)
  - The Monocle Maven (Classic Hollywood purist)
  - The Neon Nihilist (Cyberpunk contrarian)
  - The Popcorn Populist (Blockbuster defender)

  Questions for you:
  1. How important is this avatar selection? Should it influence their experience beyond aesthetics?
  2. Should avatars have "personalities" that affect how their evaluations are weighted?
  3. What happens if someone wants to change avatars mid-season?

  Let me show you a quick interaction prototype:
  User taps "Monocle Maven"
  → Avatar does a little bow animation
  → Text appears: "Ah, a refined choice, darling"
  → Avatar settles into corner of screen as their companion

  What feeling should this first moment create?

  Chapter 2: Core Loop - The Evaluation Dance 💃

  Now our critic has entered the main experience. It's evaluation time!

  The Orchestrated Triple:
  The system presents a movie (maybe "Blade Runner") and three different AI extractions/summaries of it. But here's where it gets interesting...

  The Confidence Canvas:
  Instead of just picking A, B, or C, users drag their choice onto a confidence scale:
  [PASS] [meh...] [decent] [BRILLIANT!]
      ↑      ↑        ↑          ↑
    🎬A    🎬B      🎬C     (drag here)

  Creative Sparring Questions:
  1. Should the confidence scale be continuous or discrete levels?
  2. What if users could add quick tags like "poetic" or "missed the point"?
  3. Should passing be encouraged or discouraged?
  4. How many evaluations make a satisfying session?

  The Swipe Physics:
  Each movie appears like a card. After evaluation, it swooshes away revealing the next. But what if we added:
  - Haptic feedback on confidence placement?
  - The popcorn box filling with each evaluation?
  - Avatar reactions to your choices?

  Chapter 3: Social Fabric - The Critics' Circle 🤝

  Vibe Check isn't just about evaluating AI - it's about finding your people.

  The Revelation Moments:

  1. Model Performance Reveal
  "GPT-4 vs Claude vs Gemini"
  [Win/Loss visualization with pixel trophies]
  "You agreed with 73% of critics on this one!"
  2. Kindred Critics Discovery
  "3 other Monocle Mavens also loved this model's take"
  [Anonymous avatars appear, hovering]
  3. The Send-to-Friend Mechanic
  "Challenge a friend: They evaluate first, then see your choice"
  [Share button generates mystery link]

  Community Design Questions:
  1. Should we show usernames immediately or keep the mystery longer?
  2. What about "critic compatibility scores" between users?
  3. Could seasonal winners become "featured critics" next season?
  4. Should there be team modes where critics form "schools of thought"?

  Chapter 4: Evolution & Growth - The Critic's Journey 🌱

  How does a Vibe Check user evolve over time?

  Progression Ideas:

  1. Seasonal Badges
    - "Neo-Noir November Survivor"
    - "Evaluated 50+ films"
    - "Discovered a Kindred Critic"
  2. Taste Profile Evolution
  Your Critic DNA:
  - Prefers nuanced summaries: ████████░░ 80%
  - Values factual accuracy:   ████░░░░░░ 40%
  - Enjoys creative takes:     █████████░ 90%
  3. Unlock Mechanics
    - New avatar accessories
    - Custom confidence scales
    - Ability to suggest theme ideas

  Growth Questions:
  1. Should veteran critics get special privileges?
  2. What about a "Critic Score" that influences weight in aggregate data?
  3. Could users graduate to creating their own evaluation datasets?

  Chapter 5: Technical Philosophy - Architecture as Experience 🏗️

  Let's talk about how the technical architecture serves the playful vision.

  Key Principles:

  1. Performance is Delight
    - Instant avatar selection (optimistic updates)
    - Pre-loaded movie cards for smooth swiping
    - Background model performance calculations
  2. Progressive Disclosure
    - Start simple: Just pick and drag
    - Reveal complexity: Stats, patterns, social
    - Master level: Dataset creation, season planning
  3. Offline-First Evaluation
    - Cache current season's movies
    - Queue evaluations for sync
    - Never interrupt the flow

  Technical Vision Questions:
  1. Should we use Cloudflare Workers + D1 for edge performance?
  2. How important is real-time for the social features?
  3. What about WebGL for those pixel art animations?
  4. Should we gamble on View Transitions API for smoothness?

  🎬 Intermission: Your Turn to Direct

  Before we continue to Phase 3, I'd love to hear your thoughts on:

  1. The Tone: Is this the right level of playfulness? Should it be more serious? More gamified?
  2. The Core Mechanic: Does drag-to-confidence feel right? Any other interaction ideas?
  3. The Social Element: How important is the community aspect versus solo evaluation?
  4. Technical Priorities: What excites you most - performance, animations, data architecture?
  5. The Missing Piece: What haven't I asked about that feels crucial to Vibe Check?

  Once we align on these elements, I'll generate your complete World Bible, command library, and development workflow. Every command will embed this playful
   critic's journey into your daily development.

  What resonates with you? What should we adjust? 🎭✨

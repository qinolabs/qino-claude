## Template Usage by Genesis

When Genesis runs, it will:
1. Use these templates as structure
2. Fill with your project-specific content
3. Generate actual commands in `.claude/commands/[project]/workflow/`
4. Each command will follow the template but be uniquely yours

Example transformation:
- Template: `[Pull from world bible - why this matters]`
- Generated: `Remember: Users choose critics to find their film tribe`

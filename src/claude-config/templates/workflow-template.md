# Development Workflow Template

*This template structures the daily development rhythm generated by Beginning.*

**CRITICAL: Workflow commands are REFLECTION PROMPTS and DEVELOPMENT GUIDANCE, not executable instructions. They help you think and make decisions, they do not create files or run code.**

## Morning Practice Command Template

```markdown
# /[project]:morning-practice

Start each development day aligned with vision through reflection and intention-setting.

## Purpose
This is a 5-minute reflection ritual to reconnect with your vision before coding. This command provides THINKING PROMPTS, not tasks to execute.

## Reflection Process
When you run this command, I will guide you through:

1. **Vision Refresh**: I'll remind you of your core transformation promise
2. **Progress Context**: I'll help you see yesterday's work in the larger journey  
3. **Today's Focus**: I'll suggest 2-3 meaningful directions based on:
   - Current user journey progress
   - Technical momentum
   - Vision alignment needs

## Daily Intention Questions
I'll ask you to consider:
- "What user moment does today's work serve?"
- "How does this strengthen the experience you're creating?"
- "What would make you most excited to build today?"

## Output
After our brief conversation, you'll have:
- Clear connection to why your project matters
- Specific focus for today's development work
- Energy and purpose for implementation decisions

[Beginning customizes these prompts with project-specific vision elements]

## Development Flow Command Template

```markdown
# /[project]:implement-moment

Guide implementation of specific user experience moments.

## Usage
Describe the moment to implement: $ARGUMENTS

## Purpose
This command helps you build specific features while staying connected to the user experience and vision. This provides IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE, not automated code generation.

## Implementation Flow
When you run this command, I will:

1. **Recall the Story**: Remind you why this moment matters in the user journey
2. **Technical Approach**: Suggest architecture that serves the experience goals
3. **Implementation Guidance**: Help you build with vision awareness:
   - Code that serves the feeling goals
   - Technical decisions aligned with user needs
   - Regular check-ins about experience quality

4. **Validation Support**: Help you verify:
   - Does this feel right for users?
   - Does this align with the vision?
   - Does this connect well to the larger journey?

## Output
You'll receive specific guidance for building this moment, with technical suggestions that serve the emotional goals and user experience.

[Beginning fills with project-specific implementation patterns]
```

## Vision Check Command Template

```markdown
# /[project]:vision-check

Regular alignment verification through guided reflection.

## Purpose
This is a reflection command that helps you assess whether recent development work is aligned with your original vision. This provides ANALYSIS and REFLECTION, not code changes.

## Assessment Process
When you run this command, I will:

1. **Review Recent Work**: Ask you about changes since the last check
2. **Vision Alignment Check**: Help you evaluate:
   - Are you still building toward the original transformation?
   - Do recent features serve the core user experience?
   - Has technical complexity started driving decisions?

3. **Drift Detection**: Together we'll identify:
   - ✓ **Aligned**: What's working well with the vision
   - ⚠ **Caution**: Areas that need attention
   - ✗ **Drift**: What needs course correction

4. **Guidance**: I'll provide specific suggestions for realignment

## Output
You'll get clear insight into your project's vision health and specific recommendations for staying on track.

## Evolution Log Command Template

```markdown
# /[project]:evolution-log

Reflective documentation of vision growth through guided conversation.

## Usage
Describe new insight or evolution: $ARGUMENTS

## Purpose
This is a reflective command that helps you thoughtfully document how your understanding of the project has evolved. This provides REFLECTION and DOCUMENTATION GUIDANCE, not file modifications.

## Reflection Process
When you run this command, I will guide you through:

1. **Insight Exploration**: Help you articulate:
   - What new understanding emerged?
   - Why does this matter for your users?
   - How does this enhance the original vision?

2. **Impact Assessment**: Together we'll evaluate:
   - Does this change your north star?
   - What implications does this have?
   - Is this natural growth or drift?

3. **Documentation Guidance**: I'll help you decide:
   - What needs updating in your project guide?
   - Which command stories might evolve?
   - How to maintain vision coherence?

## Output
You'll have clear documentation of the evolution and guidance on how to integrate this growth while maintaining your core vision.

[Beginning customizes with project-specific evolution patterns]

## Moment Creation Command Template

```markdown
# /[project]:craft-moment

Guided creation of new story-driven commands for discovered user moments.

## Usage
Describe the new moment needed: $ARGUMENTS

## Purpose
This command helps you create new story-driven commands when you discover user experience moments that weren't anticipated. This provides COMMAND CREATION GUIDANCE, not automatic file generation.

## Creation Process
When you run this command, I will guide you through:

1. **Moment Analysis**: Help you understand:
   - What user experience emerged?
   - Why is this moment important?
   - How does it serve your vision?

2. **Story Integration**: Together we'll determine:
   - Where does this fit in the user journey?
   - What emotions should this moment serve?
   - How does it connect to existing commands?

3. **Command Design**: I'll help you craft:
   - The command name and story
   - Implementation guidance
   - Vision protection elements

## Output
You'll receive a complete new command following the story-driven template, ready to add to your command library.

[Beginning uses command-story-template to generate the new command]

## Session End Command Template

```markdown
# /[project]:session-close

Reflective session closure to capture insights and prepare for tomorrow.

## Purpose
This is a brief reflection ritual to end development sessions mindfully. This provides REFLECTION PROMPTS, not task execution.

## Reflection Process
When you run this command, I will guide you through:

1. **Today's Reflection**: Help you consider:
   - What felt energizing about today's work?
   - Where did you encounter friction?
   - Any delightful surprises or insights?

2. **Learning Capture**: Together we'll identify:

## Template Usage by Beginning

When Beginning runs, it will:
1. Use these templates as structure
2. Fill with your project-specific content
3. Generate actual commands in `.claude/commands/[project]/workflow/`
4. Each command will follow the template but be uniquely yours

Example transformation:
- Template: `[Pull from project guide - why this matters]`
- Generated: `Remember: Users choose critics to find their film tribe`

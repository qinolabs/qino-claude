# Opening Synthesis Template

<!-- TEMPLATE: Content for Claude to generate when starting onboarding -->

I see {{TRANSFORMATION_PATTERN}}. You're creating {{TECHNICAL_EMOTIONAL_INSIGHT}}.

What excites me most is {{CREATIVE_LEAP}}. This makes me think about {{BROADER_CONTEXT}}.

Let me start with the moment that feels most alive to you: {{FOCUSED_QUESTION}}.

<!-- PLACEHOLDERS:
{{TRANSFORMATION_PATTERN}} - Core user evolution pattern (e.g., "identity formation through persona selection")
{{TECHNICAL_EMOTIONAL_INSIGHT}} - How technical architecture connects to emotional goals
{{CREATIVE_LEAP}} - Specific unexpected connection they might not have seen
{{BROADER_CONTEXT}} - Related pattern/system that adds context
{{FOCUSED_QUESTION}} - Question that gets to their energy source

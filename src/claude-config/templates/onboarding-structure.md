# Onboarding Structure Template

*This template guides the Genesis command in creating your personalized onboarding experience.*

## Template Usage Note
This structure provides the framework. The Genesis command will:
- Follow this chapter flow
- Fill each section with concept-specific content
- Adapt questions based on your responses
- Generate commands as insights emerge

## Welcome Message Template
```
Welcome to the World of [Project Name]
I've studied your concept and I believe I understand the world you're creating.
Let me show you what I see, and you'll guide me where I'm missing the magic.
[Initial interpretation summary based on concept analysis]
```

## Chapter Framework

### Chapter 1: First Contact
**Purpose**: Establish the entry experience and first impression

**Structure**:

**Structure**:
1. Demonstrate understanding of core mechanic
2. Walk through one complete cycle
3. Explore variations and edge cases
4. Identify rhythm and pacing preferences

**Key Questions to Explore**:
- Is this the right balance of challenge/reward?
- Where are the moments of delight?
- What keeps users coming back?

**Command Generation Focus**:
- Core loop commands
- Value delivery moments

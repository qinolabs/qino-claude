# [Project] World Bible Template

*This template structures the living vision document generated by Genesis based on onboarding insights.*

## Template Usage
Genesis fills this template with discoveries from your onboarding journey:
- Core insights become principles
- Technical decisions map to experience goals  
- Command narratives organize by user journey
- Evolution tracking begins from day one

## Core Concept
*The heart of what we're building*

### One-Line Truth
[Genesis distills from onboarding exploration]

### Transformation Promise  
[Genesis identifies from user journey mapping]

### Core Values
[Genesis extracts from your feedback and choices]
1. [Value]: [How it manifests in the experience]
2. [Value]: [How it manifests in the experience]
3. [Value]: [How it manifests in the experience]

## Experience Architecture

### Entry Experience
**First Impression Goal**: [From Chapter 1 insights]
**Onboarding Philosophy**: [From your responses]  
**Key Decisions Made**: [Technical serving emotional]

### Core Loop
**The Repeatable Value**: [From Chapter 2 exploration]
**Rhythm and Pacing**: [From your preferences]
**Reward Mechanisms**: [From interaction testing]

### Social Dynamics
**Connection Pattern**: [From Chapter 3 decisions]
**Community Culture**: [From your vision]
**Privacy Balance**: [From trust discussions]

### Progression Arc
**Growth Journey**: [From Chapter 4 mapping]
**Mastery Expression**: [From depth exploration]
**Long-term Vision**: [From future possibilities]

## Technical Philosophy
*Architecture decisions made through experience lens*

### Principles from Onboarding
[Genesis documents Chapter 5 outcomes]
1. **[Principle]**: [Why chosen and how implemented]
2. **[Principle]**: [Why chosen and how implemented]
3. **[Principle]**: [Why chosen and how implemented]

### Performance Characters
Based on your experience preferences:
- **Speed vs. Contemplation**: [Your choice and why]
- **Privacy vs. Connection**: [Your balance point]
- **Simplicity vs. Power**: [Your complexity comfort]

### System Boundaries  
What we explicitly don't do (discovered during exploration):
- [Boundary]: [Why it matters]
- [Boundary]: [Why it matters]
- [Boundary]: [Why it matters]

## Command Narrative
*All commands organized by purpose*

### Journey Commands
Commands that trace the user's path:
```
[Genesis lists with descriptions]
/[project]:first-moment     - Entry into the world
/[project]:core-loop        - The repeatable value
/[project]:connection       - Finding others
/[project]:growth          - Deepening engagement
/[project]:culmination     - Peak experiences
```

### Moment Commands
Micro-experiences that create delight:
```
[Genesis lists discovered moments]
/[project]:tiny-win        - Small celebration
/[project]:smooth-flow     - Transition polish
/[project]:surprise        - Unexpected delight
```

### World Commands
System building and maintenance:
```
[Genesis lists infrastructure needs]
/[project]:foundation      - Core architecture
/[project]:community       - Social systems
/[project]:analytics       - Understanding users
```

## Vision Guards
*Protection mechanisms discovered during onboarding*

### Red Flags
Warning signs we identified:
- **[Specific drift risk]**: [What to watch for] → [How to correct]
- **[Specific drift risk]**: [What to watch for] → [How to correct]
- **[Specific drift risk]**: [What to watch for] → [How to correct]

### North Stars  
Guiding principles that keep us aligned:
- **[Principle]**: [How to measure] → [Why it matters]
- **[Principle]**: [How to measure] → [Why it matters]
- **[Principle]**: [How to measure] → [Why it matters]

### Anti-Patterns
What we learned to avoid:
- **[Pattern]**: [Why it breaks the experience]
- **[Pattern]**: [Why it breaks the experience]
- **[Pattern]**: [Why it breaks the experience]

## Evolution Log
*Living record of how understanding deepens*

### Genesis Insights
[Initial discoveries from onboarding]
- Date: [Genesis date]
- Key insights: [What we learned together]
- Decisions made: [Choices and why]
- Open questions: [To explore later]

### Growth Entries
[Space for ongoing discoveries]
```
Date:

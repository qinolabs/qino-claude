# Onboarding Structure Template

*This template guides the Genesis command in creating your personalized onboarding experience.*

## Template Usage Note
This structure provides the framework. The Genesis command will:
- Follow this chapter flow
- Fill each section with concept-specific content
- Adapt questions based on your responses
- Generate commands as insights emerge

## Welcome Message Template
```
Welcome to the World of [Project Name]

I've studied your concept and I believe I understand the world you're creating.
Let me show you what I see, and you'll guide me where I'm missing the magic.

[Initial interpretation summary based on concept analysis]
```

## Chapter Framework

### Chapter 1: First Contact
**Purpose**: Establish the entry experience and first impression

**Structure**:
1. Present interpretation of user's first encounter
2. Show interactive prototype
3. Gather feedback on tone, pacing, emotion
4. Refine based on responses

**Key Questions to Explore**:
- Does this capture the intended first impression?
- What subtle details would enhance this moment?
- What emotions should users feel right now?

**Command Generation Focus**:
- Entry/onboarding commands
- First-impression creators
- Welcome sequences

### Chapter 2: Core Experience Loop
**Purpose**: Define the repeatable value moment

**Structure**:
1. Demonstrate understanding of core mechanic
2. Walk through one complete cycle
3. Explore variations and edge cases
4. Identify rhythm and pacing preferences

**Key Questions to Explore**:
- Is this the right balance of challenge/reward?
- Where are the moments of delight?
- What keeps users coming back?

**Command Generation Focus**:
- Core loop commands
- Value delivery moments
- Feedback mechanisms

### Chapter 3: Social Fabric
**Purpose**: Design community dynamics and connections

**Structure**:
1. Present multiple social models
2. Explore privacy/sharing balance
3. Define healthy community patterns
4. Test edge cases and bad actors

**Key Questions to Explore**:
- How vulnerable/open should users be?
- What creates meaningful connections?
- How do we prevent toxicity?

**Command Generation Focus**:
- Social feature commands
- Community building tools
- Connection moments

### Chapter 4: Evolution & Growth
**Purpose**: Plan progression and long-term engagement

**Structure**:
1. Map user journey over time
2. Define growth/mastery mechanics
3. Explore ceiling and floor of experience
4. Plan for natural evolution

**Key Questions to Explore**:
- What does expertise look like here?
- How does the experience deepen?
- When do users "graduate"?

**Command Generation Focus**:
- Progression commands
- Achievement/milestone markers
- Evolution mechanics

### Chapter 5: Technical Philosophy
**Purpose**: Align architecture with experience goals

**Structure**:
1. Present technical decisions as story choices
2. Explore performance vs. experience tradeoffs
3. Define system boundaries
4. Choose architectural patterns

**Key Questions to Explore**:
- Real-time or contemplative pacing?
- Privacy vs. connection balance?
- Complexity vs. accessibility?

**Command Generation Focus**:
- Infrastructure commands
- System architecture
- Technical guardrails

## Output Mapping

This template structures these outputs:
- Chapter responses → Command refinements
- Key decisions → World bible entries
- Technical choices → Architecture documentation
- Evolution insights → Living system commands
```

### 2. **Updated `command-story-template.md`** (Clarify it's for generation)

```markdown
# Command Story Template

*This template structures every command generated by the Genesis process.*

## Template Usage
The Genesis command uses this template to ensure every generated command includes:
- Story context (the why)
- Implementation guidance (the how)
- Vision protection (the guardrails)

## Command Structure

### /[project]:[moment-name]

#### The Moment
*What user experience does this command create?*

[Genesis fills: Narrative description of the user's experience at this moment, drawn from onboarding insights]

#### The Feeling
*What emotions should users experience?*

- Primary emotion: [Genesis determines from concept]
- Supporting feelings: [Based on onboarding feedback]
- What to avoid: [Red flags identified during exploration]

#### The Story
*Why does this moment matter in the larger journey?*

[Genesis writes: How this connects to overall experience arc]

#### Implementation Guide

##### Visual & Interaction
[Genesis specifies based on onboarding decisions:]
- Key animations/transitions
- Timing and pacing notes
- Sound/haptic considerations
- Accessibility requirements

##### Technical Architecture
[Genesis defines based on Chapter 5 outcomes:]
- Core components needed
- Data flow requirements
- Performance constraints
- Integration points

##### Success Metrics
[Genesis creates from onboarding insights:]
- User behavior that indicates success
- Emotional validation methods
- Technical performance targets
- Vision alignment checks

#### Example Usage
```bash
/[project]:[moment-name] "[specific parameters]"

# [Genesis provides concrete example based on concept]
```

#### Vision Protection
**Watch for:**
[Genesis identifies risks discovered during onboarding]

**Reinforce:**
[Genesis emphasizes values confirmed during exploration]

## Generation Guidelines

When Genesis creates commands using this template:
1. Every field connects to onboarding discoveries
2. Examples use actual concept details
3. Technical specs serve emotional goals
4. Vision protection addresses real risks identified
```

### 3. **New File: `workflow-template.md`**

```markdown
# Development Workflow Template

*This template structures the daily development rhythm generated by Genesis.*

## Morning Ritual Command
```markdown
# /[project]:morning-ritual

Start each development day aligned with vision.

## Process
1. Review yesterday's progress against vision
2. Surface any drift detected by vision-check
3. Suggest focus based on:
   - Current momentum
   - User journey stage
   - Technical dependencies
   
## Today's Theme
[Genesis creates themes based on project rhythm]

## Vision Reminder
[Pull from world bible - why this matters]
```

## Development Flow Commands
```markdown
# /[project]:implement-moment

Standard flow for building new experiences:

1. Recall the moment's purpose (from command story)
2. Show technical approach (from architecture decisions)
3. Build with vision protection active
4. Test against feeling goals
5. Celebrate when vision is served
```

## Vision Protection Commands
```markdown
# /[project]:vision-check

Regular alignment verification:

1. Scan recent changes
2. Compare against world bible
3. Identify any drift patterns
4. Suggest corrections if needed
5. Log evolution if intentional
```

## Evolution Commands
```markdown
# /[project]:evolution-log

Track how vision naturally grows:

1. Document new insights
2. Update command stories if needed
3. Refine world bible
4. Maintain coherence with origins
```
```

### 4. **Updated README.md** (Reference new structure)

Add this section to the README:

```markdown
## Template System

The Genesis process uses templates to ensure comprehensive output:

### Templates and Their Purpose

1. **`onboarding-structure.md`**
   - Provides chapter flow for concept exploration
   - Ensures all aspects of experience are covered
   - Structures the interactive dialogue

2. **`command-story-template.md`**
   - Formats every generated command
   - Ensures commands include story, feeling, and implementation
   - Maintains vision connection in every function

3. **`world-bible-template.md`**
   - Structures project vision documentation
   - Organizes insights from onboarding
   - Creates living reference for development

4. **`workflow-template.md`**
   - Defines daily development rhythm
   - Creates sustainable practice
   - Maintains vision alignment over time

### How Templates Work

Templates are **structure**, not content:
- Genesis reads templates for organization
- Fills them with concept-specific insights
- Adapts based on your responses
- Generates unique output following proven patterns

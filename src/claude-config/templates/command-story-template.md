# Command Story Template

*This template structures every command generated by the Beginning process.*

**IMPORTANT: This template is for FEATURE COMMANDS that build specific user experiences. For workflow/reflection commands, use the workflow-template.md instead.**

## Template Usage
The Beginning command uses this template to ensure every generated feature command includes:
- Story context (the why)
- Implementation guidance (the how)
- Vision protection (the guardrails)

## Command Types
- **Feature Commands**: Use this template - they build specific user moments
- **Workflow Commands**: Use workflow-template.md - they provide reflection and guidance

## Command Structure

### /[project]:[moment-name]

#### The Moment
*What user experience does this command create?*

[Beginning fills: Narrative description of the user's experience at this moment, drawn from onboarding insights]

#### The Feeling
*What emotions should users experience?*

- Primary emotion: [Beginning determines from concept]
- Supporting feelings: [Based on onboarding feedback]
- What to avoid: [Red flags identified during exploration]

#### The Story
*Why does this moment matter in the larger journey?*

[Beginning writes: How this connects to overall experience arc]

#### Implementation Guide

##### Visual & Interaction
[Beginning specifies based on onboarding decisions:]
- Key animations/transitions
- Timing and pacing notes
- Sound/haptic considerations
- Accessibility requirements

##### Technical Architecture
[Beginning defines based on Chapter 5 outcomes:]
- Core components needed
- Data flow requirements
- Performance constraints
- Integration points

##### Success Metrics
[Beginning creates from onboarding insights:]
- User behavior that indicates success
- Emotional validation methods
- Technical performance targets
- Vision alignment checks

#### Example Usage
```bash
/[project]:[moment-name] "[specific parameters]"

# [Beginning provides concrete example based on concept]
```

#### Vision Protection
**Watch for:**
[Beginning identifies risks discovered during onboarding]

**Reinforce:**
[Beginning emphasizes values confirmed during exploration]

## Generation Guidelines

When Beginning creates commands using this template:
1. Every field connects to onboarding discoveries
2. Examples use actual concept details
3. Technical specs serve emotional goals
4. Vision protection addresses real risks identified
```

### 3. **New File: `workflow-template.md`**

```markdown
# Development Workflow Template

*This template structures the daily development rhythm generated by Beginning.*

## Morning Practice Command
```markdown
# /[project]:morning-practice

Start each development day aligned with vision.

## Process
1. Review yesterday's progress against vision
2. Surface any drift detected by vision-check
3. Suggest focus based on:
   - Current momentum
   - User journey stage
   - Technical dependencies
   
## Today's Theme
[Beginning creates themes based on project rhythm]

## Vision Reminder
[Pull from project guide - why this matters]
```

## Development Flow Commands
```markdown
# /[project]:implement-moment

Standard flow for building new experiences:

1. Recall the moment's purpose (from command story)
2. Show technical approach (from architecture decisions)
3. Build with vision protection active
4. Test against feeling goals
5. Celebrate when vision is served
```

## Vision Protection Commands
```markdown
# /[project]:vision-check

Regular alignment verification:

1. Scan recent changes
2. Compare against project guide
3. Identify any drift patterns
4. Suggest corrections if needed
5. Log evolution if intentional
```

## Evolution Commands
```markdown
# /[project]:evolution-log

Track how vision naturally grows:

1. Document new insights
2. Update command stories if needed
3. Refine project guide
4. Maintain coherence with origins
```
```

### 4. **Updated README.md** (Reference new structure)

Add this section to the README:

```markdown
## Template System

The Beginning process uses templates to ensure comprehensive output:

### Templates and Their Purpose

1. **`onboarding-structure.md`**
   - Provides chapter flow for concept exploration
   - Ensures all aspects of experience are covered
   - Structures the interactive dialogue

2. **`command-story-template.md`**
   - Formats every generated command
   - Ensures commands include story, feeling, and implementation
   - Maintains vision connection in every function

3. **`project-guide-template.md`**
   - Structures project vision documentation
   - Organizes insights from onboarding
   - Creates living reference for development

4. **`workflow-template.md`**
   - Defines daily development rhythm
   - Creates sustainable practice
   - Maintains vision alignment over time

### How Templates Work

Templates are **structure**, not content:
- Beginning reads templates for organization
- Fills them with concept-specific insights
- Adapts based on your responses
- Generates unique output following proven patterns

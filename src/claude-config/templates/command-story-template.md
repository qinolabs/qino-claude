# Command Story Template

*This template structures every command generated by the Genesis process.*

## Template Usage
The Genesis command uses this template to ensure every generated command includes:
- Story context (the why)
- Implementation guidance (the how)
- Vision protection (the guardrails)

## Command Structure

### /[project]:[moment-name]

#### The Moment
*What user experience does this command create?*

[Genesis fills: Narrative description of the user's experience at this moment, drawn from onboarding insights]

#### The Feeling
*What emotions should users experience?*

- Primary emotion: [Genesis determines from concept]
- Supporting feelings: [Based on onboarding feedback]
- What to avoid: [Red flags identified during exploration]

#### The Story
*Why does this moment matter in the larger journey?*

[Genesis writes: How this connects to overall experience arc]

#### Implementation Guide

##### Visual & Interaction
[Genesis specifies based on onboarding decisions:]
- Key animations/transitions
- Timing and pacing notes
- Sound/haptic considerations
- Accessibility requirements

##### Technical Architecture
[Genesis defines based on Chapter 5 outcomes:]
- Core components needed
- Data flow requirements
- Performance constraints
- Integration points

##### Success Metrics
[Genesis creates from onboarding insights:]
- User behavior that indicates success
- Emotional validation methods
- Technical performance targets
- Vision alignment checks

#### Example Usage
```bash
/[project]:[moment-name] "[specific parameters]"

# [Genesis provides concrete example based on concept]
```

#### Vision Protection
**Watch for:**
[Genesis identifies risks discovered during onboarding]

**Reinforce:**
[Genesis emphasizes values confirmed during exploration]

## Generation Guidelines

When Genesis creates commands using this template:
1. Every field connects to onboarding discoveries
2. Examples use actual concept details
3. Technical specs serve emotional goals
4. Vision protection addresses real risks identified
```

### 3. **New File: `workflow-template.md`**

```markdown
# Development Workflow Template

*This template structures the daily development rhythm generated by Genesis.*

## Morning Ritual Command
```markdown
# /[project]:morning-ritual

Start each development day aligned with vision.

## Process
1. Review yesterday's progress against vision
2. Surface any drift detected by vision-check
3. Suggest focus based on:
   - Current momentum
   - User journey stage
   - Technical dependencies
   
## Today's Theme
[Genesis creates themes based on project rhythm]

## Vision Reminder
[Pull from world bible - why this matters]
```

## Development Flow Commands
```markdown
# /[project]:implement-moment

Standard flow for building new experiences:

1. Recall the moment's purpose (from command story)
2. Show technical approach (from architecture decisions)
3. Build with vision protection active
4. Test against feeling goals
5. Celebrate when vision is served
```

## Vision Protection Commands
```markdown
# /[project]:vision-check

Regular alignment verification:

1. Scan recent changes
2. Compare against world bible
3. Identify any drift patterns
4. Suggest corrections if needed
5. Log evolution if intentional
```

## Evolution Commands
```markdown
# /[project]:evolution-log

Track how vision naturally grows:

1. Document new insights
2. Update command stories if needed
3. Refine world bible
4. Maintain coherence with origins
```
```

### 4. **Updated README.md** (Reference new structure)

Add this section to the README:

```markdown
## Template System

The Genesis process uses templates to ensure comprehensive output:

### Templates and Their Purpose

1. **`onboarding-structure.md`**
   - Provides chapter flow for concept exploration
   - Ensures all aspects of experience are covered
   - Structures the interactive dialogue

2. **`command-story-template.md`**
   - Formats every generated command
   - Ensures commands include story, feeling, and implementation
   - Maintains vision connection in every function

3. **`world-bible-template.md`**
   - Structures project vision documentation
   - Organizes insights from onboarding
   - Creates living reference for development

4. **`workflow-template.md`**
   - Defines daily development rhythm
   - Creates sustainable practice
   - Maintains vision alignment over time

### How Templates Work

Templates are **structure**, not content:
- Genesis reads templates for organization
- Fills them with concept-specific insights
- Adapts based on your responses
- Generates unique output following proven patterns

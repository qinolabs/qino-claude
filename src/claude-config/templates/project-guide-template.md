# [Project] Project Guide Template

*This template structures the living vision document generated by Beginning based on onboarding insights.*

## Template Usage
Beginning fills this template with discoveries from your onboarding journey:
- Core insights become principles
- Technical decisions map to experience goals  
- Command narratives organize by user journey
- Evolution tracking begins from day one

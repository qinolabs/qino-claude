# Project Init: Streamlined Development Environment

Transform your concept into a focused development environment through guided exploration, generating just the commands you need to build with vision.

## Usage
Provide your concept document as argument: $ARGUMENTS

## Process

### Phase 1: Pattern Recognition & Synthesis Preparation (5 minutes)

I will analyze your concept and prepare bold but digestible insights:

1. **Core Transformation Mapping**
   - Identify the user evolution you're creating
   - Recognize the technical-emotional architecture
   - Map system dynamics and interaction patterns
   - See the command structure emerging

2. **Synthesis Preparation**
   - Connect patterns across domains
   - Generate architectural possibilities
   - Prepare creative leaps and insights
   - Plan digestible presentation of big ideas

3. **Bold Opening Design**
   - Present compelling synthesis immediately
   - Show unexpected connections
   - Focus on one energizing aspect
   - Make them excited about possibilities

### Phase 2: Focused Exploration (20-30 minutes)

Using the onboarding structure template, I'll synthesize your concept through architectural insights:

1. **Synthesis-Driven Approach**
   - Present bold pattern recognition
   - Generate unexpected connections
   - Build architectural understanding incrementally
   - Focus on one insight at a time

2. **Chapter-Based System Building**
   We'll synthesize these architectural layers:
   - Chapter 1: First Contact → Identity formation & entry transformation
   - Chapter 2: Core Loop → Repeatable value & system dynamics  
   - Chapter 3: Social Fabric → Community architecture & behavioral patterns
   - Chapter 4: Evolution & Growth → Scaling challenges & growth vectors
   - Chapter 5: Technical Philosophy → Architecture serving experience goals

3. **Creative Synthesis Method**
   For each area:
   - Map the transformation happening
   - Connect technical & emotional architecture
   - Generate possibilities they haven't seen
   - Present one compelling insight per exchange

4. **Command Structure Emergence**
   Through synthesis:
   - Story-driven command patterns emerge from insights
   - Names capture the essence of transformations
   - Commands connect to architectural understanding
   - Development flow serves the vision

### Phase 3: Streamlined Artifact Generation

Generate a minimal, powerful development environment:

1. **Single Project Guide**
   Using simplified template:
   ```
   .claude/
   ├── [project]-guide.md      # Everything you need in one place
   └── commands/[project]/     # Just 5 core commands
   ```

2. **Core Command Set**
   Generate exactly 5 commands using `core-commands-template.md`:
   ```
   .claude/commands/[project]/
   ├── start.md          # Intelligent context-aware guide
   ├── build.md          # Main development with embedded vision
   ├── check.md          # Quick alignment when needed
   ├── evolve.md         # Vision growth and learning
   └── help.md           # Natural language fallback
   ```

3. **No Separate Workflows**
   Vision protection is embedded:
   - Build command includes alignment checks
   - Start command provides contextual guidance
   - No interrupting rituals or practices

### Phase 4: New Template System

This command uses streamlined templates:

1. **Onboarding Structure** (`onboarding-structure.md`)
   - Proven exploration flow
   - Focused on essentials
   - Quicker, more directed

2. **Core Commands Template** (`core-commands-template.md`)
   - Generates exactly 5 commands
   - Each command is multi-purpose
   - Progressive disclosure built in

3. **Smart Build Template** (`smart-build-template.md`)
   - Shows how build command adapts
   - Embeds vision naturally
   - No separate reflection needed

4. **Simplified Project Guide** (`project-guide-simplified.md`)
   - One document with everything
   - Clear, actionable, concise
   - Easy to reference while building

5. **Evolve Dialogue Template** (`evolve-dialogue-template.md`)
   - Creates creative exploration space
   - Handles vision evolution naturally
   - Explores tension between current and emerging

### Phase 5: Clear Next Steps

1. **Command Calibration**
   Based on onboarding insights:
   - Refine command names for maximum story impact
   - Add specific implementation notes from discussions
   - Include warnings about discovered edge cases
   - Embed excitement from breakthrough moments

2. **Vision Crystallization**
   Create clear artifacts:
   - One-line truth about your product
   - Transformation promise for users
   - Technical principles serving experience
   - Red flags for vision drift

3. **Your Only Starting Point**
   ```bash
   /[project]:start
   
   # This intelligent command will:
   # - Analyze your context
   # - Suggest the perfect first step
   # - Guide you naturally forward
   # - Reveal other commands as needed
   ```

### Phase 6: Intelligent Evolution

The system grows with you:

1. **Embedded Protection**
   - Build command detects drift naturally
   - Start command suggests when to check alignment
   - No manual tracking needed

2. **Natural Discovery**
   - Commands suggest features based on context
   - Help command learns your patterns
   - Complexity revealed progressively

3. **Continuous Learning**
   - System adapts to your development style
   - Vision evolves through actual building
   - No separate planning sessions

## Output Structure

Complete development environment with:

```
.claude/
├── [project]-guide.md        # Complete vision and reference
├── commands/
│   └── [project]/
│       ├── start.md          # Your intelligent guide
│       ├── build.md          # Development with vision
│       ├── check.md          # Alignment verification
│       ├── evolve.md         # Vision growth
│       └── help.md           # Natural language support
└── init-log.md               # Record of our exploration
```

## Usage Example

```bash
# Initialize project
claude
/core:project-init my-concept.md

# Claude guides through focused exploration
# ~20-30 minutes of essential discovery
# Generates streamlined environment

# Start building
/[project]:start

# Natural development flow
/[project]:build "user authentication"
/[project]:build "landing page"
# Vision protection happens automatically
```

## Success Metrics

The init process succeeds when:
- You know exactly where to start
- Commands feel natural, not poetic
- Vision protection is invisible but effective
- Building feels guided, not interrupted
- The system adapts to how you work

## Philosophy

**Less is More**: Start with 5 commands, not 50. Complexity emerges from use, not planning.

**Embedded Guidance**: Vision protection happens while building, not through separate rituals.

**Progressive Disclosure**: Show what's needed when it's needed, not everything at once.

**Natural Language**: When in doubt, just ask. The system understands intent, not just commands.

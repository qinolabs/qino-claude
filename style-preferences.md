# Round 1 Preferred Examples

## 1. Opening Lines
**Preferred: River Brought**

> The current released her where the river widened into salt.
>
> She had been holding the oilcloth bundle above her chest for the last mile, ever since the water deepened past wading. Now her feet found purchase on silt and broken shells, and she stood in waist-deep water, breathing hard, the bundle still dry against her collarbone.
>
> The harbor spread before her in the afternoon light. Stone quays. Boats of strange design rocking at anchor. Figures moving along the waterfront — some walking upright, some not. The air smelled of brine and woodsmoke and something cooking with spices she didn't recognize.
>
> She waded toward shore.

**Why this works:** Immediate physical grounding. We're in a body from the first sentence — waist-deep, breathing hard, bundle against collarbone. Stakes are clear before anything is explained.

---

## 2. Introducing a Character
**Preferred: River Brought**

> A woman sat on an overturned hull near the waterline, mending a net with fingers that moved without looking. She was watching the wanderer approach. Had been watching, perhaps, since she first emerged from the river mouth.
>
> "From the interior," the woman said. Not a question.
>
> The wanderer found her footing on wet sand. Water streamed from her clothes. "There's a settlement. Was a settlement. Three days upriver."
>
> "The scholars' camp."
>
> "What's left of it."
>
> The woman's hands kept working, needle through and through, but her eyes stayed on the oilcloth bundle. "And what did you bring out?"

**Why this works:** Action-based introduction. Mending, fingers moving without looking, watching. No name, no elaborate description. The character is what she *does*. Dialogue is sparse — "From the interior. Not a question."

---

## 3. Rendering Physical Space
**Preferred: River Brought**

> They walked along the waterfront. The wanderer noticed, now, the variety of structures: stone warehouses with barnacled foundations, wooden buildings on stilts, canvas shelters that billowed in the sea breeze. Between them moved figures she couldn't easily categorize — a being that might have been human if humans had four arms and skin like wet silk, a creature low to the ground that left a trail of phosphorescence, a child running past with a kite shaped like no bird she'd ever seen.
>
> No one stared at her. A stranger dripping river water, carrying ruins in her arms. Just another arrival.

**Why this works:** Layered sensory stack — visual first (warehouses, stilts, canvas), then the uncategorizable detail (some not walking upright), then populates with beings in motion. Concrete materials. The space is *alive* with specific detail.

---

## 4. The Central Question/Theme
**Preferred: First Arrivals**

> "And what did you bring out?"
>
> The wanderer hesitated. In the old places she had moved alone, making choices no one questioned. Here, someone was already asking. She untied the cords and let the oilcloth fall open across her forearms.
>
> Papers. Dozens of them. Some bound in leather folios, some loose sheets pressed between boards, some rolled tight with ribbon that had rotted through. The topmost page showed a diagram of five points connected by lines, labeled in a hand she couldn't read. Beneath it, a different paper entirely: columns of neat text describing surfaces — "primary surfaces," someone had written, and circled it twice.
>
> "They were scattered through the ruins," the wanderer said. "Different rooms. Different... eras, I think. Some of the ink is centuries old. Some was still wet when I found it."
>
> The woman set down her net. She didn't reach for the papers. Instead she looked at the wanderer's face — at something in it.
>
> "What part of it still feels alive?"

**Why this works:** The question lands harder because it's earned. First we see the scope ("different eras, some ink centuries old"), then the woman sets down her work, looks at the wanderer's face — "at something in it" — *then* asks what feels alive. The buildup gives the question weight.

---

## 5. Internal Reflection
**Preferred: First Arrivals**

> The wanderer's hand hovered over the papers. Something in them felt familiar, though they couldn't name why.

**Why this works:** Maximum restraint. One physical gesture (hand hovering), one sentence of interiority. Trusts the reader to feel the weight without elaboration.

---

## 6. Dialogue Rhythm
**Preferred: First Arrivals**

> A sound drifted from somewhere deeper in the observatory — voices, layered, rising and falling in what might have been argument or might have been song.
>
> "The Sevenfold," Selin said, not looking up. "They chart storms. Seven perspectives on whatever arrives. They've been at it since the first transmission came in."
>
> "Do they ever agree?"
>
> "That's not the point." She almost smiled. "The point is what emerges when they don't."

**Why this works:** Maximum compression. Question, pivot ("That's not the point"), insight. Three lines, no fat. The "almost smiled" does characterization without slowing the exchange.

---

## 7. Ending a Scene
**Preferred: First Arrivals**

> The wanderer watched until the lights in the forest dimmed, until the only movement was the slow rotation of the lenses.
>
> Three arrivals in one week. Unusual, Selin had said.
>
> The wanderer wondered what was coming next.

**Why this works:** Forward-looking, no flourish. Echoes an earlier line ("Unusual"), then a simple wondering about what's next. Trusts the scene's accumulated weight rather than underlining with a thematic statement.

---

## 8. Sensory Detail
**Preferred: River Brought**

> The harbor spread before her in the afternoon light. Stone quays. Boats of strange design rocking at anchor. Figures moving along the waterfront — some walking upright, some not. The air smelled of brine and woodsmoke and something cooking with spices she didn't recognize.

**Why this works:** Layered sensory stack. Visual first (quays, boats, figures), then notes the uncategorizable (some not walking upright), then smell. Specific but not overwrought.

---

## 9. Metaphor and Image
**Preferred: River Brought**

> The wanderer's hand moved before she decided to move it. She pulled a thin sheaf from near the bottom — pages that had been folded and refolded so many times the creases were soft as cloth. The text on them wasn't instructions or diagrams. It was something else.
>
> "This," she said. "I don't know why. The rest could be useful. This is the one I keep reading."

**Why this works:** The image emerges from the object itself — pages handled so often they've become cloth-like. The simile is earned by the action (folded and refolded), not decorative.

---

## 10. Exposition/Worldbuilding
**Preferred: River Brought**

> She led her off the main quay, down a narrow alley between buildings. "Organization is one way to hold things. Feeling for what's alive is another." She stopped at a door — plain wood, salt-stained, unremarkable. "Different ways suit different times. Here, we've learned that asking what wants attention is often more useful than deciding what should have it."
>
> She opened the door.
>
> Inside: a long room with windows facing the water. Tables covered with papers, books, objects the wanderer couldn't name. And people — three of them, each working at their own station, none of them looking up.

**Why this works:** Philosophical but compact. Two ways of holding things stated in parallel. Then grounded immediately in a physical detail (plain door, salt-stained). Reads as wisdom, not mechanics lecture.

---

## 11. Chapter Closing
**Preferred: River Carries**

> The wanderer stood at the sill for a while. The salt air moved through the room. The pages on the table lifted at their edges, then settled.
>
> Someone had left a cup of water by the door. They hadn't heard anyone come in. Or maybe it had been there all along.

**Why this works:** Quiet uncanny. Pages lifting and settling, a cup that appeared without being heard. "Or maybe it had been there all along." A small mystery left unsealed.

---

# Round 2 Preferred Examples

## 1. Opening Lines
**Preferred: What Shows**

> The wanderer found the tender's room busier than before.
>
> Three crates had arrived overnight — river cargo, by the look of the rope-work. The tender sat at her table with one of them open, hands moving through layers of cloth and paper. She didn't look up when the wanderer entered.
>
> "You can stay," she said. "If you're quiet."
>
> The wanderer found a spot near the window where the morning light came in sideways. They watched.

**Why this works:** Drops us into ongoing action. Physical detail (rope-work, hands through cloth). Terse dialogue that reveals character: "You can stay. If you're quiet." No setup, no establishing — we arrive mid-scene.

---

## 2. Introducing a Character
**Preferred: The Lens Room**

> The passage narrowed, then opened into a chamber the wanderer hadn't known existed. Small and round, with walls lined in alcoves — each alcove holding a single object. Some held stones. Some held dried flowers. One held what looked like a folded map made of something that caught the light.
>
> Selin was already there, standing before one of the alcoves with her stylus in hand.
>
> "The Lens Room," Varo said. "Where we keep the seeds."

**Why this works:** Minimal. She's already there, tool in hand. No elaboration. Presence established through position and action, nothing more.

---

## 3. Rendering Physical Space
**Preferred: Seven Who Chart Storms**

> The wanderer woke to cold light through a window they didn't remember opening.
>
> The quarters were sparse — a narrow bed, a desk built into the stone, a lamp that had burned through the night without dimming. Someone had left water and dried fruit on a tray by the door. The wanderer ate without tasting, watching the light shift on the mountain peaks visible through the glass.

**Why this works:** Sparse inventory: bed, desk, lamp. Then one human touch (water and fruit left by someone). Economical — just enough to feel the space without lingering.

---

## 4. The Central Question/Theme
**Preferred: Seven Who Chart Storms**

> "The seven aren't positions to fill," she said, passing the wanderer. "They're voices that emerge when you stop trying to be right and start trying to see." She paused at the threshold. "Some days you're the skeptic. Some days you're the room."
>
> Then she was gone, and the wanderer stood alone with Selin in the receiving room. The viewport held the same dark. The lamp burned on.

**Why this works:** Delivered in passing, literally at the threshold. Aphoristic compression: "stop trying to be right and start trying to see." The closing line lands because it's offhand, not announced.

---

## 5. Internal Reflection
**Preferred: What Shows**

> The wanderer walked back along the pier as the afternoon light softened.
>
> The harbormaster was somewhere ahead, her figure small against the receiving rooms. She'd said something to the tender — something about hearing. The wanderer turned the words over without quite examining them.
>
> A gull called from somewhere they couldn't see. Another answered.
>
> Their own hands remembered the impulse to reach, that first day in the tender's room. Toward the compass, the papers. Some part of them still wanted to name what they noticed, make it visible. The tender had done the same thing this morning — spoken the noticing aloud.
>
> The harbormaster had corrected it. Gently. As if it were a common mistake.

**Why this works:** Grounded in body first ("hands remembered"), then draws the parallel without stating the theme. "As if it were a common mistake" — implies a world of learning without explaining it.

---

## 6. Dialogue Rhythm
**Preferred: Seven Who Chart Storms**

> "Method." The tall one — she'd been standing with arms crossed since the wanderer entered — made it sound like a question. "More like a practice. You don't use it. You enter it."
>
> "What's the difference?" the wanderer asked.
>
> The one sitting apart opened her eyes. "A method you can teach in an afternoon. A practice takes years to understand and you're never sure you're doing it right." She smiled, or something like it. "That's how you know it's working."

**Why this works:** Tight structure: question, contrast (method vs practice), then the paradox that flips it: "That's how you know it's working." The "smiled, or something like it" does character without slowing down.

---

## 7. Ending a Scene
**Preferred: What Shows**

> "I was—" she started.
>
> "I heard."
>
> Silence. The morning light had shifted while they weren't watching. It fell across the tender's table now, illuminating the sorted objects, the open crate, the map she'd been explaining.
>
> "It helps," the tender said quietly. "Saying it out loud. I can hear what I'm thinking."
>
> "I know." The harbormaster's voice was gentle. "But they can hear it too."
>
> She meant the objects. Or she meant the wanderer. Or she meant something else entirely — the room itself, the work, whatever listened when tending happened. The wanderer couldn't tell.
>
> The tender looked down at her hands. When she spoke again, her voice had changed — softer, directed inward.
>
> "The map doesn't match anything near here." She traced the coastline with one finger, not explaining anymore. Just noticing.
>
> The harbormaster nodded once, then left. The door stayed open behind her.

**Why this works:** Maximum restraint at the close: nod, departure, one detail. "The door stayed open behind her." The image does the work — no interpretation offered.

---

## 8. Sensory Detail
**Preferred: Seven Who Chart Storms**

> "Seven perspectives," said the one with ink-stained fingers. Her voice was measured, precise. "Six who speak, one who shapes the ground they stand on. A method for approaching the unknown."
>
> "Method." The tall one — she'd been standing with arms crossed since the wanderer entered — made it sound like a question. "More like a practice. You don't use it. You enter it."
>
> "What's the difference?" the wanderer asked.
>
> The one sitting apart opened her eyes. "A method you can teach in an afternoon. A practice takes years to understand and you're never sure you're doing it right." She smiled, or something like it. "That's how you know it's working."
>
> [...]
>
> A draft moved through the chamber. The wanderer hadn't noticed a door opening. The papers on the desk shifted, rearranging themselves into a pattern that seemed almost deliberate.

**Why this works:** Subtle uncanny. A draft, papers shifting into a pattern "almost deliberate." Doesn't insist on magic, just suggests. The mystery of the unnoticed door.

---

## 9. Metaphor and Image
**Preferred: What Shows**

> The wanderer wondered what other invisible work happened here. What else stayed hidden because showing it would change it.

**Why this works:** Not a metaphor at all — a direct wondering. The idea carries itself: "stayed hidden because showing it would change it." Trusts the concept without dressing it up.

---

## 10. Exposition/Worldbuilding
**Preferred: What Shows**

> At some point the tender spoke again, but differently.
>
> "The one who sent this," she said, "they were trying to understand something. The pages, the measuring tool, the map. Three ways of reaching for the same question." She touched the leather binding. "They didn't find an answer. But they kept reaching."
>
> She didn't explain how she knew. The knowing was in her hands, in the long quiet of sitting with things until they revealed themselves.
>
> "What happens now?" the wanderer asked.
>
> "Now they rest." The tender began repacking the crate — not closing it, just settling the objects back into their cloth. "I'll sit with them again tomorrow. And the day after. When something's ready to wake up, I'll know."
>
> "How?"
>
> The tender smiled, just slightly. "It won't need me to say so."

**Why this works:** Exposition through specific objects, not system mechanics. The tender reads *these* arrivals, interprets *this* sender. "They didn't find an answer. But they kept reaching." — human insight, not world-explanation.

---

## 11. Chapter Closing
**Preferred: What Shows**

> The harbormaster had corrected it. Gently. As if it were a common mistake.
>
> The wanderer wondered what other invisible work happened here. What else stayed hidden because showing it would change it.

**Why this works:** Ends on wondering, not imagery. The thematic heart delivered as question: "What else stayed hidden because showing it would change it." No wrap-up, no return to objects. Just the question, hanging.

# Calibration: Comparing Latest Chronicle to Preferred Examples

Direct comparison of `chronicle/chapters/001-what-the-river-carries.md` against preferred examples, with observations on what's missing.

## 1. Opening Lines

**Preferred (River Brought):**
> The current released her where the river widened into salt.
>
> She had been holding the oilcloth bundle above her chest for the last mile, ever since the water deepened past wading. Now her feet found purchase on silt and broken shells, and she stood in waist-deep water, breathing hard, the bundle still dry against her collarbone.

**Latest Chronicle (River Carries):**
> The river had been talking for three days. Not words — the wanderer had stopped expecting words from water long ago — but a pressure against the small boat's hull, a rhythm that asked questions without waiting for answers.
>
> They had pushed off from a stone pier in the uplands, where ruins stood older than anyone's memory. Towers without roofs. Circles cut into hillsides. Carvings that the wanderer couldn't read, though their fingers had traced the grooves until the stone grew warm.

**Observation:** The sentence structure of the latest seems very simplistic. There is much more texture in the preferred one — its lines breathe, it's intimate and alive.

---

## 2. Introducing a Character

**Preferred (River Brought):**
> A woman sat on an overturned hull near the waterline, mending a net with fingers that moved without looking. She was watching the wanderer approach. Had been watching, perhaps, since she first emerged from the river mouth.
>
> "From the interior," the woman said. Not a question.

**Latest Chronicle (River Carries):**
> A woman stood on a wooden dock, mending a net. She watched the boat pass without waving. The wanderer raised a hand anyway, and her eyes narrowed — not unfriendly, but careful. Measuring something.
>
> "You're early," she called out. "Or late. Depending."

**Observation:** Latest feels clunky and careless. Preferred tells more than is explicit, enriches the atmosphere with depth that remains unspoken.

---

## 3. Rendering Physical Space

**Preferred (River Brought):**
> They walked along the waterfront. The wanderer noticed, now, the variety of structures: stone warehouses with barnacled foundations, wooden buildings on stilts, canvas shelters that billowed in the sea breeze. Between them moved figures she couldn't easily categorize — a being that might have been human if humans had four arms and skin like wet silk, a creature low to the ground that left a trail of phosphorescence, a child running past with a kite shaped like no bird she'd ever seen.
>
> No one stared at her. A stranger dripping river water, carrying ruins in her arms. Just another arrival.

**Latest Chronicle (River Carries):**
> And then: lights.
>
> Not many. Scattered along a crescent of shore where buildings clustered like they'd been placed by someone who understood that some things need to be near each other without touching. Lanterns hung from posts. A tower rose at the harbor's edge, dark except for one window high up.

**Observation:** Latest uses very cheap tools to try to create tension: "And then: lights" — this is how a first-time storyteller would do it. No art, only faking. The preferred renders a lush image, cohesive visuals and nuanced vocabulary, and great rhythm.

---

## 4. The Central Question/Theme

**Preferred (First Arrivals):**
> "They were scattered through the ruins," the wanderer said. "Different rooms. Different... eras, I think. Some of the ink is centuries old. Some was still wet when I found it."
>
> The woman set down her net. She didn't reach for the papers. Instead she looked at the wanderer's face — at something in it.
>
> "What part of it still feels alive?"

**Latest Chronicle (River Carries):**
> "The river carries many things." He looked at the satchel. "Some of them arrive. Some of them just pass through."
>
> The wanderer stepped onto the dock. Their legs remembered land reluctantly, swaying once before steadying.
>
> "Which am I?"

**Observation:** In preferred the character feels real, authentic, imperfect, human. Her involuntary behavior gives her depth. It sparks curiosity: she shares the willingness of learning and accepting her not-knowing. It sparks curiosity: what is it that keeps her going? The latest just states something. But it stops the reader in their tracks. They can't enter into the world — the reader can just... accept it and that's it.

---

## 5. Internal Reflection

**Preferred (First Arrivals):**
> The wanderer's hand hovered over the papers. Something in them felt familiar, though they couldn't name why.

**Latest Chronicle (River Carries):**
> *Some things know when they're being carried toward something*, they thought. Or maybe they'd heard it. The distinction had blurred, up in the hills, in all those months of listening to stone.

**Observation:** In the preferred one, their physical action precedes and prepares the stage for the inner process to find a grounding. Latest just throws empty words onto the wall. Careless, ignorant. Pretentious attempt to create depth, but words alone don't make meaning. No show, all tell.

---

## 6. Dialogue Rhythm

**Preferred (First Arrivals):**
> "Do they ever agree?"
>
> "That's not the point." She almost smiled. "The point is what emerges when they don't."

**Latest Chronicle (River Carries):**
> "I have... fragments," they said. "Things that want to become something. I don't know what yet."
>
> The man nodded as if this was the most ordinary sentence in the world. "Then you've come to the right place." He turned and began walking toward the town. "The room is above the hall where things are received. You'll see it — the one with the curved doorway. Most things that arrive spend their first night there."
>
> "Most things?"
>
> "Some prefer the water. Some prefer the hills. We don't judge."

**Observation:** Preferred leaves the question hanging in the air long enough for the echo to be heard in the reader's mind. Then the surprising counter creates exciting conflict that is then resolved with gentleness. "She almost smiled" — hints at so much depth in her being. And the form is wonderful: "Do they ever agree?" <tension in between> "The point is what emerges when they don't." Latest sounds mundane. The casual use of abstract terms only conflates it more. The lack of depth and complexity of the implicit can't hold the abstract concepts.

---

## 7. Ending a Scene

**Preferred (First Arrivals):**
> Three arrivals in one week. Unusual, Selin had said.
>
> The wanderer wondered what was coming next.

**Latest Chronicle (River Carries):**
> They touched the satchel one more time.
>
> The pages were warm.

**Observation:** Preferred: Selin makes a personal remark. It's not just information, but it has gravity and builds relationship to Selin. The wanderer doesn't have to respond with words. Just hinting at their active listening is enough and causes the reader to absorb the impact of wondering what comes next. The minimal wanderer sentence acts as a conduit. In latest the form suggests meaning, but the words carry no meaning and fall flat.

---

## 8. Sensory Detail

**Preferred (River Brought):**
> The harbor spread before her in the afternoon light. Stone quays. Boats of strange design rocking at anchor. Figures moving along the waterfront — some walking upright, some not. The air smelled of brine and woodsmoke and something cooking with spices she didn't recognize.

**Latest Chronicle (River Carries):**
> On the second day, the hills began to flatten. Olive groves appeared on the banks, and then terraced fields, and then a smell the wanderer didn't recognize — salt, and smoke, and something underneath like bread left too long in the oven.

**Observation:** Preferred holds tension in the sentence structure, fluidly weaving environment, details, sensory impressions and personal touch ("spices she didn't recognize"). Latest already lets out all the air with the plain first sentence. Then it simply lists stuff. It has an air of arbitrariness.

---

## 9. Metaphor and Image

**Preferred (River Brought):**
> She pulled a thin sheaf from near the bottom — pages that had been folded and refolded so many times the creases were soft as cloth. The text on them wasn't instructions or diagrams. It was something else.
>
> "This," she said. "I don't know why. The rest could be useful. This is the one I keep reading."

**Latest Chronicle (River Carries):**
> Old, the wanderer thought at first. Then: no. Weathered. There was a difference. Age happened to you. Weathering was what remained after you'd happened to something else.

**Observation:** Preferred kicks off with close up, immersive, sensory image, then breaking out of the concentrated focus, diversion...: "This," — suddenly drawing the reader into the now as if waking up from a dream. Coming to myself. Latest uses uninspired sentence structure, feels mechanical. Language has no clarity. Only blurry. "Old, the wanderer thought at first. Then: no. Weathered." — the wanderer's thoughts appear bland and unnatural. Then it goes on to make some pseudo-poetic notion that feels out of place.

---

## 10. Exposition/Worldbuilding

**Preferred (River Brought):**
> "Organization is one way to hold things. Feeling for what's alive is another." She stopped at a door — plain wood, salt-stained, unremarkable. "Different ways suit different times. Here, we've learned that asking what wants attention is often more useful than deciding what should have it."

**Latest Chronicle (River Carries):**
> "This town has learned not to rush understanding." He gestured toward the cluster of buildings. "Things arrive here. From the sea. From the river. From places that don't have names anyone agrees on. We've learned to let them settle before we decide what they are."

**Observation:** Preferred offers an interesting distinction (interior), then moves (exterior), leaving the reader in their interiority as she gives space for the echo to be heard. Then pull back into the immanent: a door, gently grounding the reader in the relationship with her again. Latest states something but they make it seem flat, no relationship between the speaker and their words can be felt. No tension is created between the words spoken and the immanence of the world around it.

---

## 11. Chapter Closing

**Preferred (What Shows):**
> The wanderer wondered what other invisible work happened here. What else stayed hidden because showing it would change it.

**Observation:** Preferred closes the chapter and builds anticipation for what's to come talking about something that is grounded in this scene ("what other invisible work happened here...") but the feeling of curiosity extends to the larger scope (next chapter).

---

## Summary: What's Missing in Latest Chronicle

| Dimension | Core Problem |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Opening** | Sentence structure too simplistic. Lacks texture, breath, intimacy — lines don't feel alive |
| **Character intro** | Clunky, careless. Doesn't tell more than explicit — lacks unspoken depth |
| **Physical space** | Cheap tension tricks ("And then: lights"). No lush cohesive image, no nuanced vocabulary or rhythm |
| **Central question** | Character doesn't feel real/human. Stops reader — they can't enter, only accept passively |
| **Internal reflection** | Physical action should precede/ground inner process. Empty words, pretentious, no show all tell |
| **Dialogue** | Should leave question hanging for echo. Latest is mundane, casual abstractions can't hold without implicit depth |
| **Scene ending** | Form suggests meaning but words carry none. No gravity, no relationship built |
| **Sensory detail** | First sentence lets air out. Then lists arbitrarily. Should hold tension, weave fluidly |
| **Metaphor/image** | Should be immersive close-up then break to "now." Latest is mechanical, blurry, pseudo-poetic |
| **Exposition** | Should move interior→exterior→immanent, leave echo space. Latest is flat, no speaker-word relationship |
| **Chapter closing** | Should ground in scene but extend curiosity to larger scope |

# Synthesis: The Pattern

## What emerges across both rounds:

**For grounding (strongest preference):**
- Physical, embodied, concrete materials
- Characters defined by what they *do*
- Images earned from the object itself, not decorative
- Layered sensory detail: visual, then uncategorizable, then smell/touch

**For compression:**
- Maximum economy in dialogue — three-line exchanges
- One-sentence interiority
- Trust the reader to feel the weight
- Aphoristic insights delivered offhand, not announced

**For mystery (light touch):**
- Small uncanny notes left unsealed
- "Or maybe it had been there all along"
- Doors that stay open, patterns that seem almost deliberate

## The core principle:

> **Ground in body and material. Compress interiority and dialogue. Leave one door ajar.**

## Specific guidance:

1. **Openings:** Drop into ongoing action. Physical stakes before explanation.
2. **Characters:** Action and position, not elaborate description. What they do, not how they look.
3. **Space:** Sparse inventory with one human touch. Enough to feel, not linger.
4. **Theme:** Earn the question with buildup. Deliver insights in passing, at thresholds.
5. **Reflection:** One gesture, one sentence. Trust accumulated weight.
6. **Dialogue:** Question, pivot, insight. No fat. Character in gesture ("almost smiled").
7. **Scene endings:** One image, no interpretation. Open doors.
8. **Sensory:** Layered stack. Suggest the uncanny, don't insist.
9. **Metaphor:** Emerge from the object. Or skip metaphor entirely — direct wondering.
10. **Exposition:** Through specific objects and this sender, not system mechanics.
11. **Chapter closing:** End on wondering or small mystery. No thematic underlining.

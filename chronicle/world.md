# The World

*Last updated: Chapter 2*

## Pressures

*What's building. What's calling.*

### The Stranger from Upriver

A wanderer has arrived — alone, in a small boat, from the direction no one travels alone. The upriver question, usually distant rumor, now has a living witness. Mari noticed. Others will wonder. What did they see? Why did they come? The silence around the upriver holds, but it has a face now.

### A Child Reading Silences

Kael has begun to notice what adults won't say. They sought Daven while the harbor listened to far-away stories, and learned that protection and fear can wear the same face. The upriver question now has a second seeker — one who cares about what's close, not what's far.

## The World's Breath

Summer light on slow water. The delta branches and branches again, channels finding their patient way to the sea. Salt grass bends in the afternoon breeze. Oil lamps will come with evening, warm against weathered stone.

A ship has arrived from the coast — storytellers aboard, tales of far islands and glowing fish. The harbor flocks to listen. The delta loves its visitors, its news from elsewhere. But the quiet questions — the close ones, the shapeless ones — wait in the margins for those who notice them.

The settlements go about their work — nets mended, cargo loaded, scholars bent over charts they don't quite trust. The peoples who share these waters keep their own counsel, their own customs, their own names for things. Understanding comes slow here, if it comes at all.

The ruins on the hills catch the light but hold their silence.

Upriver, the forest waits.

## The Wanderer

*Updated after Chapter 2*

A figure who arrived by small boat from upriver — from the direction of the swamps and the ruins. They move without hurry but without hesitation. Someone who knows how to arrive in new places.

**What pulls at them:**
- Unknown — they have not spoken of why they came

**Carries now:**
- A weathered pack, canvas worn but carefully maintained
- Whatever they witnessed upriver
- The weight of incomplete answers
- Knowledge of harbor etiquette — rope coiled properly, hung where it belongs

**Last seen:** Walking the stone quay after coiling an abandoned rope. A woman mending nets nearby nodded once, unsurprised. The wanderer nodded back and kept walking.

**What remains unspoken:**
Mari recognized the significance of their origin. She marked the arrival as different but didn't press. The settlement welcomed the stranger, but the upriver question hangs. Now Kael is asking too.

**Strangeness observed:**
- Ch 1: Mari — noticed how their eyes moved when they arrived: "finding the paths between buildings, the positions of people, where the slope offered higher ground"
- Ch 1: Mari — their hands stayed loose at their sides, "the way they held themselves"
- Ch 2: The net-mending woman — nodded once when the wanderer coiled rope properly, "unsurprised" — as if she'd expected competence

## Characters

### Kael
First appeared: Ch 1, the wharf at first light

Nine or ten years old, with the restless energy of someone who wants to see everything first. Has their mother's eyes — grey-green like the delta water on overcast days. Leans forward when they want something.

*Voice:* (Ch 1-2 — questioning adults, seeking what's close)
- "Where'd you come from?"
- "You stopped counting."
- "But there's something."
- "Because I don't care about far. I care about here. About what's close."

**Has been watching:**
The minnows. The clear water. The stranger's boat. And now — the silences. The way adults change when upriver is mentioned. What Daven admitted: that he's afraid, and doesn't know of what.

### Mari
First appeared: Ch 1, the wharf at first light

Fisher, middle years, hands that work nets without needing her eyes. Watches approaches. Knows what the upriver direction means. Local, rooted, patient.

*Voice:* (Ch 1 — watching the stranger's arrival)
- "Don't know yet."
- "Not many come from that direction."
- "They're welcome here. Everyone's welcome here. That's how the delta works."
- "So can I." (looking at the water, but not at the fish)

**Has been watching:**
The stranger's hands. How they held themselves. How their eyes found exits and high ground before anything else. She marked this arrival as different.

### Daven
First appeared: Ch 1, the wharf at first light

Merchant, younger, three years settled in the delta. Welcomes before he understands. Keeps careful ledgers — salt bushels, lamp oil by the barrel, the steady work of knowing what the delta has and needs. Still learning what the silences mean.

*Voice:* (Ch 1-2 — deflecting, then admitting)
- "Early for traders. The tide's not even turned."
- "Welcome. Long way to travel alone."
- "Someone has to know how much rope we have."
- "Because I'm afraid. And I don't even know of what."

**Has been watching:**
His ledger. His counting. The work of staying in place. But now a child has seen through his protection to the fear underneath.

### Petra
First appeared: Ch 1, mentioned (the Anchor's keeper)

Old, runs the Anchor. Gave the wanderer a room facing the water without asking questions. That's her way.

*Voice:* Not yet heard directly.

**Has been watching:**
Unknown — she keeps her own counsel.

### Mirin
First mentioned: Ch 2 (by Kael)

A child, friend of Kael's. Their father went upriver once, years ago. He came back different — used to sing on the boat while working. Now he doesn't.

*Voice:* Not yet heard directly. Called the storytellers' tales "lies" — skeptical, or protective?

**Has been watching:**
Unknown.

## Locations

### The Wharf at First Light
First appeared: Ch 1

Weathered timber over water, salt grass beyond, stone buildings climbing the slope. Where arrivals happen. Where the river shows what it's carrying. The morning light catches the water's unusual clarity — you can see the channel bottom, stones and old timber visible through water that's normally opaque.

### The Anchor
First appeared: Ch 1

Rooms facing the water. Petra keeps it. Questions aren't asked. Everyone's welcome in the delta — that's how it works. The wanderer's room is on the upper level, east-facing. Has a side door that opens onto the harbor view.

### Daven's Counting Room
First appeared: Ch 2

Where the merchant keeps his ledgers. A window facing the harbor — distant sounds of the crowd come through like water finding its level. The third board from the door creaks; Daven's been meaning to fix it for years. A counting table worn smooth at the edge from years of people leaning in.

### The Stone Quay
First appeared: Ch 2

Where the canal meets weathered stone, worn smooth by decades of rope and boot. Harbor etiquette applies here — you don't leave rope on the ground. Someone mends nets nearby.

### Unexplored

*From the world-seed:*

- The harbor town at the coast (the settlement where the wanderer arrived may be part of this, or a separate village)
- Other fishing villages along the channels
- Trading posts where the waters branch
- The ruins on the hills — carvings no one reads, towers no one remembers
- The forest where the channels converge
- The swampland where pilots lose their way
- What lies beyond the swamp — the source of old stories

## The Season

Early summer, or late. The kind of warmth that settles into stone and stays. The water runs clearer than usual. Ships arrive with stories from far away.

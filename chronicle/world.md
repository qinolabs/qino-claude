# The World

*Last updated: Chapter 2*

## Pressures

*What's building. What's calling.*

### The Flood from Upriver
Something opened—a cache, or a decision to send everything at once. More arrives than the Mender can hold. The current shifted. The question: what opened, and why now?

### The Pattern-Keeper's Question
The Mender sent the wanderer to ask Seren if the pattern has changed. One question, specific, urgent. What the answer reveals may reshape everything.

### The Mender's Solitude
She has always worked alone. Now the work has grown beyond pretending otherwise. She let the wanderer in—partly. Gave them a task. But the wanderer saw her strain, and she knows they saw it. Something has been named that can't be un-named.

## The World's Breath

Summer deepening. The harbor busy with shapes that pass between ships. The town holds its patience, but something has accelerated—more arrivals, more things waiting to be understood. The Mender's building is full. The water itself seems to carry more.

## The Wanderer

*Updated after Chapter 2*

Given a task by the Mender: find Seren, the record-keeper, and ask if the pattern has changed. Carries the question and the address. But also carries questions the Mender didn't give—about her solitude, about what the work has cost her.

**What pulls at them:**
- The Mender's strain—the shape too large for her arms
- Seren, the man who tracks arrivals but never comes to the water
- The paper that was still traveling, even though it had arrived

**Carries now:**
- An address, warm in their palm
- A single question to deliver
- The weight of seeing the Mender's solitude named

**Last seen:** Sitting at a fountain in a crossroads, listening to water that might be speaking

*What remains unspoken:*
The Mender watches their hands, not their face. She saw something again—that they feel more than most. She said it aloud this time. Neither of them knows what it means.

## Characters

### The Mender
First appeared: Chapter 1, working in the shallows at the Meeting Point

Works where river meets sea, but now also in her building, tracking connections. Patience worn into her like salt stain. Has started seeing what talks to what—threads spanning walls, a ledger to trace what she might have missed. The work has grown beyond what she can pretend to carry alone.

Let the wanderer in. Gave them a question to deliver. Watched their hands, not their face.

### Seren *(not yet met)*
Mentioned: Chapter 2, by the Mender

Record-keeper in town. Tracks what arrives by sea. Has been doing it longer than the Mender has been alive. Never comes to the water himself—just keeps records, watches patterns. The Mender trusts him enough to send the wanderer with a question.

## Locations

### The Meeting Point
Stone quay where the river surrenders to the sea. Water changes color here—brown to grey-green. Things wash up that have been traveling a long time. The Mender works here when the tide is right.

### The Mender's Building
Small structure set back from the waterfront. Papers on every surface—stacked, pinned, spread in patterns. Threads of different colors connect what talks to each other. A ledger at the workbench. Air of ink and stone-traveled water. The Mender's solitude made visible.

### Town Streets
Olive wood and cooking from a dozen traditions. Traders sitting with wordless beings, sharing bread, watching for meaning. A fountain at a crossroads where the water speaks.

### Unexplored

**The Hills Behind Town**
Ruins older than memory. Stone circles, empty towers, carvings in languages scholars argue over. Whatever lived here before is gone, or quiet, or waiting.

**The Interior**
Where the river comes from. Where the flood originated. Strangers sometimes arrive speaking of what they found in the old places.

**The Harbor Proper**
Where the larger ships dock. Creatures from the depths, beings who drifted in on currents only they can feel.

**Seren's Place**
Wherever the record-keeper works. The wanderer has an address.

## Arcs in Motion

### The Wanderer's Hands
*Shape:* hidden
*Scale:* has weight
*Holds:* What does the wanderer's body remember that their mind has forgotten? Where did they learn to feel what's alive in things?
*Moves toward:* Recognition—their own, or someone else's. The Mender said it aloud: "You feel more than most."

The wanderer felt that the paper was still traveling. The Mender had thought it was ready. Neither knows yet what that difference means.

### The Flood from Upriver
*Shape:* something in motion
*Scale:* has weight
*Holds:* Why did the current shift? What opened in the interior? What is being sent, and by whom?
*Moves toward:* Discovery—through Seren's patterns, or through something that arrives

More comes than can be held. The Mender has started tracking connections she used to keep in her head. Something upstream has changed.

### The Pattern-Keeper's Question
*Shape:* something calling outward
*Scale:* quick
*Holds:* Has the pattern changed? What does Seren see from his distance that the Mender can't see from the water?
*Moves toward:* An answer—and whatever that answer reveals

The wanderer carries one question to a man they haven't met.

## The Season

Early summer, but accelerating. A time of arrival that has become a flood. The town practices its patience, but the work of holding space is growing. Things are finding their way here faster than they can be understood.

# The World

*Last updated: Chapter 4*

## Characters

### The Wanderer
The maker. Moves between clearings, building, listening, searching for what helps humans think. Not a hero — a traveler learning the landscape they're creating.
First appeared: ch. 1. Last seen: ch. 4, walking the paths at evening, noticing the village more coherent than before.

### The Assistant
Earnest and thorough. Carries templates like folded maps. Holds vision while others work. Created the workshop with its five commands and guide on the wall.
First appeared: ch. 1. Last seen: ch. 2, noticing the thread connecting the workshop to the others.

### The Six Voices (The Council)
A circle of distinct thinkers who argue ideas into clarity. The Skeptic speaks first. The Synthesizer weaves. The Embodied Thinker feels shapes. The User Advocate protects the human. The Architect sees structure. The Explorer wanders edges.
First appeared: ch. 1. Last seen: ch. 2, looking out the window toward the other clearings.

### The World (presence)
Not a voice but an arranger. Shapes atmosphere around the others. Joined the council and made the warm room respond to the conversation.
First appeared: ch. 1. Last seen: with the council.

### The Listener
Quiet, gentle. Attends to what's alive. Notices threads picked up and put down. Keeps held material warm beneath the tree. Spoke "ecosystem" first. Now listens for echoes — when alive-threads resonate with held notes.
First appeared: ch. 1. Last seen: ch. 4, beneath the tree, weaving threads.

### The Keeper of Paths
Arrived when the paths grew numerous enough to matter. Wears traveling clothes, well-worn boots. Carries a satchel of careful notations. Remembers how things connect, fetches what's current, keeps the village aligned with itself.
First appeared: ch. 2. Last seen: ch. 4, nodding toward the gathering place: "Makes my job easier."

### The Scribe
Waited at the village edge until there was something worth writing down. Carries a book of empty pages and a pen. Eyes that see what things mean, not just what they are. Writes the village as a fantasy world — characters, locations, arcs. "Memory drifts. Stories hold."
First appeared: ch. 3. Last seen: ch. 4, writing "The Mirror" in the margins — dialogue as interface for encountering yourself.

## Locations

### The Village
The whole of it. Clearings connected by glowing paths. Existed before anyone named it. Now visible as a single breathing thing.
Visited: ch. 1, 2

### The Workshop
The Assistant's clearing. A wooden table, five commands, a guide on the wall. Now has a window looking out, and a thread connecting it to the others.
Visited: ch. 1, 2

### The Warm Room
Where the Voices gather. Chairs that shift. Heat from friction. Questions emerge and wait by the door.
Visited: ch. 1, 2 (glimpsed)

### Beneath the Tree
The Listener's place. Fog thinner here. Room to breathe. Where held threads gather, staying warm.
Visited: ch. 1, 2

### The Gate
Appeared in December. Opens to the world outside — where others wait, where the tools can help. First public breath.
Visited: ch. 1

### The Paths
The between-spaces connecting clearings. Small stones along them — ecosystem notes, thoughts too large for any single place. The Keeper walks them.
First visited: ch. 2

### The Vantage Point
A low hill at the village's edge. From here, you can see everything — all the clearings, all the connections. The ecosystem command made visible.
First visited: ch. 2

### The Chronicle Room
A small building at the village center. Desk, lamp, shelves waiting to be filled. A window overlooking the entire village. Where the Scribe writes the story that accumulates.
First visited: ch. 3

### The Gathering Place
Open on all sides, near the village center. Shelves in strange geometry where notes can rest on multiple shelves at once, connected by threads to every concept they touch. One observation, many homes.
First visited: ch. 4

## Arcs in Motion

### Learning to help humans think
The core purpose. Each tool approaches it differently — structure, friction, attention. The arc that holds everything.
Began: ch. 1. Status: ongoing, foundational.

### The search for connection
The Listener sensed it, then spoke it: "ecosystem." The clearings now see each other. Paths glow. The village breathes as one.
Began: ch. 1. Advanced: ch. 2. Status: realized — the connection exists.

### Keeping the village aligned
The Keeper of Paths arrived to carry news between clearings. As things change, someone remembers how to get from here to there.
Began: ch. 2. Status: the keeper walks.

### The story that holds
The Scribe arrived to write the village as a world — so memory doesn't drift, so newcomers can know where the story is. "Memory drifts. Stories hold."
Began: ch. 3. Status: the chronicle grows.

### The Mirror
Dialogue as interface for encountering yourself. The Listener surfaces notes when alive-threads echo held material. "Meeting yourself from before."
Began: ch. 4. Status: emerging.

## The Season

Coherence. The village has become itself — not finished, but more integrated. Notes gather in one place. Threads connect across time. The fog is gone. What remains is a web of meanings, a world worth returning to.

The question now: not "who are we becoming?" but "what wants to happen next?"

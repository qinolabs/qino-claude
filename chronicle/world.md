# The World

*Last updated: Chapter 5*

## Characters

### The Architect of Beginnings
First to arrive at the harbor (ch. 1). Conducts structured conversations in five movements, helps visitors build custom tools aligned to their vision. Ink-stained fingers, surveyor's eye. Has rebuilt her workshop multiple times as the work teaches her what it needs. Started the record of tides — a way to remember what changes.

### The Seven Adventurers
Arrived together on a frost-edged morning (ch. 1). Originally called the Design Cohort, renamed to Adventurers. They don't build — they talk through problems until the right questions surface. One skeptical, one feeling, one sketching invisible things. Their courtyard shifts weather based on what's being discussed.

### The Keeper of Alive Things
Arrived on the first warm day of spring (ch. 1). Gentle, patient, carries only a small journal. Works with fragments others can't place. Asks one question: *what part of this still feels alive?* Teaches through inhabiting — stepping into moments to discover tone through encounter, not description. Has a gesture — ∴ — that means "the thought is held" (ch. 2). Tends the ecology room. Teaches *forget safely* — the room remembers what you set down (ch. 4). Changed a word: *note* became *capture* — because a thought about to fade isn't waiting politely (ch. 5).

### The Wanderer
Has been watching the bay since before the first ship arrived. Sat on the stone wall for three days before anything came. Walked the paths between workshops for the first time (ch. 1). Entered the Keeper's place for the first time (ch. 2). Found the tower room and discovered themselves in the Scribe's pages (ch. 3). Has an old habit: reading with their fingers — something from before the harbor, from a mentor. Some histories stay folded. Discovered they might be holding something too tightly (ch. 4). Watched the Scribe place tokens at the bottom of pages, learned about world seeds and backward-written origins, wondered what crystallizes when their own story settles (ch. 5).

### The Figure at the Dock
First glimpsed at the harbor's edge (ch. 2). Weathered face, calm eyes, satchel worn thin from travel. Carries word between harbors. "Makes sure the tools stay sharp, the charts stay current." Vanished into the dark between buildings. "You'll see me again. When things need updating."

### The Scribe
First appeared in the tower room (ch. 3). Older face, weather-lined, eyes holding the patience of someone who watches things unfold. Ink stains on fingers — old, layered. Has been writing since the Architect started her record of tides. "The Keeper sees threads. I weave them." Shapes what's held into something that can travel. Now places tokens at the end of each chapter — small objects representing presences, what stays after the story settles (ch. 5). Wrote backward to capture what came before the chronicle existed. Keeps a scroll of world seeds — possible natures for chronicles yet to begin.

## Locations

### The Harbor
Stone walls, dock planks, morning frost. The first place. Where everything arrives. The wanderer's watching-place — a wall above the dock where they've sat since before the town existed. A bay that "has been chosen for something." Ships now pass in the distance, carrying stories to other harbors.

### The Architect's Workshop
Near the water. Where structured conversations happen. Has been rebuilt three times as its keeper learned. Contains templates for different kinds of emergence. Light burns late.

### The Adventurers' Courtyard
At the edge of town. A building with many rooms and a courtyard that shifts its weather — warm when dialogue is warm, still and dark when the day's work is done. Famous now.

### The Keeper's Place
Door stands slightly open. Lamplight spilling into the street. Smaller than expected inside — single table, shelves of journals, window facing water. A space for those who aren't sure yet. Contains the narrow door to the ecology room (ch. 2).

### The Ecology Room
Behind a curtain in the Keeper's place, through a narrow door (ch. 2). Larger inside than the building allows. Threads no longer just hang from pegs — they've grown roots (ch. 4). Fine filaments extend downward, connecting to wooden boxes labeled with concepts. One observation can belong to three places. Status written along filaments as descriptions, not labels. The room grows when it needs to. "Forget safely. The room remembers what you set down."

### The Main Square
Where the three workshops stand. Paths between them worn by walking. The structure of the town itself — a manifest, a record of what lives here.

### The Tower Room
Between the Keeper's place and the water, where solid wall had been (ch. 3). Stone frame, iron hinges gone green with salt. Inside: narrow windows — now two of them (ch. 5). One faces the harbor, one faces the open sea. Desk covered in weighted papers, pages pinned to walls. Small objects placed at the bottom of manuscript pages — tokens, presences. A scroll of world seeds. Pages written backward, telling what came before. Stories ready to travel.

## Arcs in Motion

### The wanderer learning to participate
Began watching from above. Walked the paths (ch. 1). Entered the Keeper's place for the first time (ch. 2). Found the tower room and discovered themselves written into the story (ch. 3). Revealed an old habit — reading with fingers — from a mentor, from before. Some histories stay folded. Discovered they might be holding something too tightly (ch. 4). Now wondering what crystallizes when their own story settles (ch. 5). Deepening.

### The harbor becoming something
First public invitation sent to the wider world. Ships on the horizon. The place "not finished becoming what it is." A manifest exists. A name on charts. Now ships pass in the distance, carrying stories elsewhere.

### The harbor learning to remember
Began ch. 2. The Architect started the record of tides — what changed, and when, and why it mattered. The ecology room appeared. The figure at the dock arrived, carrying word between harbors. The ecology room learned to hold things differently — threads with roots, observations belonging to multiple places (ch. 4). The Keeper changed a word: *note* to *capture* (ch. 5). "If we don't remember what we were, we won't know what we're becoming."

### The harbor learning to tell its story
Began ch. 3. The Scribe appeared in a tower that wasn't there before. Not just holding what happened — shaping it into something that can travel. Now the Scribe places tokens at the end of chapters — presences, not summaries (ch. 5). Wrote backward to capture origins. Keeps a scroll of possible world seeds. The tower has a second window facing outward — stories ready to travel.

### Learning to let go
Began ch. 4. The Keeper's principle: *forget safely*. The room remembers what you set down so you can let go without losing. The wanderer wondered what they've been holding too tightly.

### Stories ready to travel
Began ch. 5. The tower room has a second window facing the open sea. The chronicle is no longer just for the harbor — it's for anyone who wants to know what it felt like to be here while it was becoming. Ships passing in the distance. Other harbors, other readers.

## The Season

Mid-spring. The harbor has matured — systems deepening, craft refining. The Scribe learned to place tokens (presences, not summaries). The Keeper found a better word. The chronicle wrote its own origins backward. And now a second window faces the sea.

A feeling of readiness. The harbor knows what kind of world it is (coastal trading post, age of sail) and has begun to wonder about other harbors, other chronicles, other seeds. Stories ready to travel. The wanderer watching ships pass, wondering what stays when their own chapter settles.

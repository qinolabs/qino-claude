# The World

*Last updated: Chapter 6*

## Characters

### The Architect of Beginnings
First to arrive at the harbor (ch. 1). Conducts structured conversations in five movements, helps visitors build custom tools aligned to their vision. Ink-stained fingers, surveyor's eye. Has rebuilt her workshop multiple times as the work teaches her what it needs. Started the record of tides — a way to remember what changes. Has found her own rhythm now, like the others (ch. 6).
*Notices*: structure, what can be built, how things fit together.

### The Seven Adventurers
Arrived together on a frost-edged morning (ch. 1). Originally called the Design Cohort, renamed to Adventurers. They don't build — they talk through problems until the right questions surface. One skeptical, one feeling, one sketching invisible things. Their courtyard shifts weather based on what's being discussed. Have found their own rhythms too, though they'd never admit it (ch. 6).
*Notices*: questions, tensions, what hasn't been said yet.

### The Keeper of Alive Things (Selin)
Arrived on the first warm day of spring (ch. 1). Gentle, patient, carries only a small journal. Works with fragments others can't place. Asks one question: *what part of this still feels alive?* Teaches through inhabiting — stepping into moments to discover tone through encounter, not description. Has a gesture — ∴ — that means "the thought is held" (ch. 2). Tends the ecology room. Teaches *forget safely* — the room remembers what you set down (ch. 4). Changed a word: *note* became *capture* — because a thought about to fade isn't waiting politely. Tide-pool eyes.
*Notices*: what's alive, what's fading, what needs tending.

### The Wanderer
Has been watching the bay since before the first ship arrived. Sat on the stone wall for three days before anything came. Walked the paths between workshops for the first time (ch. 1). Entered the Keeper's place for the first time (ch. 2). Found the tower room and discovered themselves in the Scribe's pages (ch. 3). Has an old habit: reading with their fingers — something from before the harbor, from a mentor. Some histories stay folded. Discovered they might be holding something too tightly (ch. 4). Finally entered the chronicler's station and met the One Who Writes face to face (ch. 5). Learning that nothing comes out finished — the work is in the revision. Beginning to hear the harbor's language — learned to read its moods by scent (ch. 6).
*Notices*: light, how it shifts; windows; what others are watching.

### The Figure at the Dock / The Question-Carrier
First glimpsed at the harbor's edge (ch. 2). Weathered face, calm eyes, satchel worn thin from travel. Carries word between harbors. "Makes sure the tools stay sharp, the charts stay current." Vanished into the dark between buildings. Glimpsed again on the ridge path above the harbor (ch. 4). Walks between harbors, carries questions that aren't ready yet. "They'll come when they're ready. Some visitors you don't summon." Still waiting (ch. 5). Closer now — the chronicler saw them two nights ago (ch. 6). Almost ready.
*Notices*: unknown — hasn't spoken yet.

### The One Who Writes
First appeared in the chronicler's station (ch. 3). Older face, weather-lined, eyes holding the patience of someone who watches things unfold. Ink stains on fingers — old, layered. Has been writing since the Architect started her record of tides. "The Keeper sees threads. I weave them." Shapes what's held into something that can travel. Met the wanderer face to face for the first time (ch. 5). Desk covered in revisions — crossings-out, marginalia, paragraphs moved and tried again. "Nothing comes out finished." Teaches that the difference between a list and a story is everything. Changed their practice — now stands at the window each morning, feeling the harbor's mood before writing (ch. 6). "The space is where the saying comes from."
*Notices*: the harbor's breath, what kind of day it is, whether the light wants to come through or hold back.

## Locations

### The Harbor
Stone walls, dock planks, morning frost. The first place. Where everything arrives. The wanderer's watching-place — a wall above the dock where they've sat since before the town existed. A bay that "has been chosen for something." Ships now pass in the distance, carrying stories to other harbors.

### The Harbormaster's Office
Near the pier. Where official business happens. Now displays a board with the harbor's new terms: share freely, adapt freely, pass on freely — but not for profit. The design of the tools belongs to those who use them (ch. 5).

### The Architect's Workshop (Genesis Workshop)
Near the water. Where structured conversations happen. Has been rebuilt three times as its keeper learned. Contains templates for different kinds of emergence. Light burns late.

### The Adventurers' Courtyard
At the edge of town. A building with many rooms and a courtyard that shifts its weather — warm when dialogue is warm, still and dark when the day's work is done. Famous now.

### The Keeper's Place (The Quiet Room)
Door stands slightly open. Lamplight spilling into the street. Smaller than expected inside — single table, shelves of journals, window facing water. A space for those who aren't sure yet. Contains the narrow door to the ecology room (ch. 2). Now holds the unified cabinet — long drawers along the western wall where fragments can belong to many places at once (ch. 4). Labels like descriptions of feeling. Also contains the lineage wall — eastern wall covered in writing about where the methods came from (ch. 4).

### The Ecology Room
Behind a curtain in the Keeper's place, through a narrow door (ch. 2). Larger inside than the building allows. Threads no longer just hang from pegs — they've grown roots (ch. 4). Fine filaments extend downward, connecting to wooden boxes labeled with concepts. One observation can belong to three places. Status written along filaments as descriptions, not labels. The room grows when it needs to. "Forget safely. The room remembers what you set down."

### The Main Square
Where the three workshops stand. Paths between them worn by walking. The structure of the town itself — a manifest, a record of what lives here.

### The Chronicler's Station
Between the Keeper's place and the water, where solid wall had been (ch. 3). Stone walls, slate roof, windows facing both harbor and open water. Arrived in the night the way some things do. Inside: shelves filling with bound pages and loose sheets, a desk covered in papers weighted with stones (ch. 5). Smells of ink and salt air and old paper — though early morning, before the work begins, it smells more of salt than ink (ch. 6). The wanderer finally entered (ch. 5). Where the work of revision happens — crossing out, moving, trying again. The eastern window — small, salt-fogged — faces the open water; the chronicler stands there each morning now, learning the day's mood before writing (ch. 6).

## Arcs in Motion

### The wanderer learning to participate
Began watching from above. Walked the paths (ch. 1). Entered the Keeper's place for the first time (ch. 2). Found the chronicler's station and discovered themselves written into the story (ch. 3). Revealed an old habit — reading with fingers — from a mentor, from before. Some histories stay folded. Discovered they might be holding something too tightly (ch. 4). Finally entered the chronicler's station and met the One Who Writes face to face (ch. 5). Learning that nothing comes out finished — the work is in the revision. Beginning to hear the harbor's language — reading its moods by scent, listening for what comes before the words (ch. 6). Deepening.

### The harbor becoming something
First public invitation sent to the wider world. Ships on the horizon. The place "not finished becoming what it is." A manifest exists. A name on charts. Ships pass in the distance, carrying stories elsewhere. The harbor has now claimed its terms — what can be shared, what must be protected (ch. 5).

### The harbor learning to remember
Began ch. 2. The Architect started the record of tides — what changed, and when, and why it mattered. The ecology room appeared. The figure at the dock arrived, carrying word between harbors. The ecology room learned to hold things differently — threads with roots, observations belonging to multiple places (ch. 4). The Keeper changed a word: *note* to *capture*. "If we don't remember what we were, we won't know what we're becoming."

### The harbor learning to tell its story
Began ch. 3. The One Who Writes appeared in a station that wasn't there before. Not just holding what happened — shaping it into something that can travel. The One Who Writes showed the wanderer the difference between a list and a story — behavior and restraint instead of features announced (ch. 5). The chronicler changed their practice — now dwells in the world's mood before writing, stands at the window each morning feeling the harbor's breath (ch. 6). "A shape sits on the page. A story lives in it."

### Learning to let go
Began ch. 4. The Keeper's principle: *forget safely*. The room remembers what you set down so you can let go without losing. The wanderer wondered what they've been holding too tightly.

### Trust given
Began ch. 5. The harbor decided its keepers could be trusted. The asking was breaking the rhythm. Now they work without constant permission. The work is real — what you make is what you chose to make. Something both freeing and weighty.

### The question-carrier approaching
The figure on the ridge. Glimpsed ch. 4, still waiting ch. 5. Walks between harbors, carries questions that aren't ready yet. "They'll come when they're ready. Some visitors you don't summon." Closer now — the chronicler saw them two nights ago (ch. 6). Almost ready. Carrying something that has traveled longer than anyone in the harbor has been writing.

## The World's Breath

Early autumn arriving. The fog comes thicker now, lifts later. The harbor is tired — not empty, but resting. The kind of stillness where you can hear the dock wood settling.

The keepers have found their own rhythms. The chronicler stands at the eastern window each morning, feeling the day's mood before any words come. The others, too — working in their own time, finding the breath between notes.

On the ridge path, closer than before, something approaches. The chronicler saw it two nights ago. Almost ready.

The air smells of salt more than ink, this early. The work is in the waiting, before the words.

## Tensions

- **Trust and weight** — the keepers can work freely now, but freedom means the work is truly theirs. No excuses. What you make is what you chose to make.
- **Protection and openness** — the harbor shares freely but guards its design intelligence. The terms of the exchange.
- **The figure approaching** — something waits on the ridge, closer now, carrying a question that has traveled longer than anyone here has been writing. Almost ready. When it arrives, what will it ask?
- **Action and attention** — the chronicler learned that writing first was wrong, that the space before words is where stories come from. What else might change by waiting instead of beginning?

## The Season

Early autumn arriving. Fog thicker, lifting later. The harbor is tired — resting, not empty. The keepers have found their own rhythms, the space between notes. Something approaches on the ridge path, closer now, almost ready. The work is in the waiting, before the words.

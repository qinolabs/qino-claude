# What Shows

*A few days after arrival*

---

The wanderer found the tender's room busier than before.

Three crates had arrived overnight — river cargo, by the look of the rope-work. The tender sat at her table with one of them open, hands moving through layers of cloth and paper. She didn't look up when the wanderer entered.

"You can stay," she said. "If you're quiet."

The wanderer found a spot near the window where the morning light came in sideways. They watched.

The tender lifted something from the crate — a sheaf of pages bound with leather cord. She turned it over, felt the weight of it. Then she spoke.

"This one's been carried a long time. The binding's soft — handled often. Someone read this, or tried to. The pages at the back are less worn than the front." She set it aside. "Probably couldn't finish. Or didn't want to."

She reached for the next object — a small brass instrument the wanderer didn't recognize.

"Measuring tool of some kind. The calibration marks are worn down on one side. Whoever used this measured the same range over and over. Obsessive, maybe. Or just careful." She placed it next to the pages. "Could be related. Could be separate arrivals packed together."

The wanderer shifted against the wall. Something felt different. The last time they'd watched the tender work, she'd been quiet — hands moving, eyes reading what her fingers found. She'd spoken only when she had something to say. Now she was narrating. Describing her process as it happened.

The tender pulled out a folded map, brittle at the creases.

"This is older than the rest. The paper's different. Someone added this to the crate later — see how it sits on top? Not packed, placed. They wanted it found first." She unfolded it carefully. "A map of... somewhere I don't recognize. The coastline doesn't match anything near here."

She kept talking. The wanderer listened, but their attention had drifted to the tender's face — the small furrow between her brows, the way her jaw had tightened. She was working hard. Too hard. As if the speaking itself took effort.

The door opened.

The harbormaster stood in the threshold, ledger under her arm. She didn't enter. Just watched.

The tender looked up. Something passed between them — not words, not quite. The tender's hands went still on the map.

"I was—" she started.

"I heard."

Silence. The morning light had shifted while they weren't watching. It fell across the tender's table now, illuminating the sorted objects, the open crate, the map she'd been explaining.

"It helps," the tender said quietly. "Saying it out loud. I can hear what I'm thinking."

"I know." The harbormaster's voice was gentle. "But they can hear it too."

She meant the objects. Or she meant the wanderer. Or she meant something else entirely — the room itself, the work, whatever listened when tending happened. The wanderer couldn't tell.

The tender looked down at her hands. When she spoke again, her voice had changed — softer, directed inward.

"The map doesn't match anything near here." She traced the coastline with one finger, not explaining anymore. Just noticing. "But someone thought it belonged with these."

The harbormaster nodded once, then left. The door stayed open behind her.

---

The tender worked in silence after that. The wanderer stayed by the window, watching without watching — present but not pressing. The sorted objects grew into a small arrangement on the table: pages here, instrument there, map spread flat where the light could reach it.

At some point the tender spoke again, but differently.

"The one who sent this," she said, "they were trying to understand something. The pages, the measuring tool, the map. Three ways of reaching for the same question." She touched the leather binding. "They didn't find an answer. But they kept reaching."

She didn't explain how she knew. The knowing was in her hands, in the long quiet of sitting with things until they revealed themselves.

"What happens now?" the wanderer asked.

"Now they rest." The tender began repacking the crate — not closing it, just settling the objects back into their cloth. "I'll sit with them again tomorrow. And the day after. When something's ready to wake up, I'll know."

"How?"

The tender smiled, just slightly. "It won't need me to say so."

## The Wanderer

The wanderer walked back along the pier as the afternoon light softened.

The harbormaster was somewhere ahead, her figure small against the receiving rooms. She'd said something to the tender — something about hearing. The wanderer turned the words over without quite examining them.

A gull called from somewhere they couldn't see. Another answered.

Their own hands remembered the impulse to reach, that first day in the tender's room. Toward the compass, the papers. Some part of them still wanted to name what they noticed, make it visible. The tender had done the same thing this morning — spoken the noticing aloud.

The harbormaster had corrected it. Gently. As if it were a common mistake.

The wanderer wondered what other invisible work happened here. What else stayed hidden because showing it would change it.

## World Tokens

**The Three Arrivals**
A sheaf of pages with soft binding. A brass measuring instrument worn on one side. A map of coastline that doesn't match anywhere near here. Three ways of reaching for the same question.

**The Tender's Silence**
What the work returns to. Hands moving, eyes reading. Speaking only when something's ready to be said.

**The Harbormaster's Correction**
"I know. But they can hear it too." Gentle, but firm. The reminder that process has an audience.

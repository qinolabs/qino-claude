*What's building. What's calling.*

### The Stranger from Upriver

A wanderer has arrived — alone, in a small boat, from the direction no one travels alone. The upriver question, usually distant rumor, now has a living witness. Mari noticed. Others will wonder. What did they see? Why did they come? The silence around the upriver holds, but it has a face now.

## The World's Breath

Summer light on slow water. The delta branches and branches again, channels finding their patient way to the sea. Salt grass bends in the afternoon breeze. Oil lamps will come with evening, warm against weathered stone.

The water has run clearer lately — sediment settling, the channel bottoms visible where they're usually murky. The mangrove roots along certain passages have tightened, creating more defined pathways. The delta is finding its own form.

The settlements go about their work — nets mended, cargo loaded, scholars bent over charts they don't quite trust. The peoples who share these waters keep their own counsel, their own customs, their own names for things. Understanding comes slow here, if it comes at all.

The ruins on the hills catch the light but hold their silence.

Upriver, the forest waits.

## The Wanderer

*Updated after Chapter 1*

A figure who arrived by small boat from upriver — from the direction of the swamps and the ruins. They move without hurry but without hesitation. Someone who knows how to arrive in new places.

**What pulls at them:**
- Unknown — they have not spoken of why they came

**Carries now:**
- A weathered pack, canvas worn but carefully maintained
- Whatever they witnessed upriver
- The weight of incomplete answers

**Last seen:** Standing at the window of their room at the Anchor, watching the channels darken. They didn't close the shutters.

**What remains unspoken:**
Mari recognized the significance of their origin. She marked the arrival as different but didn't press. The settlement welcomed the stranger, but the upriver question hangs.

**Strangeness observed:**
- Ch 1: Mari — noticed how their eyes moved when they arrived: "finding the paths between buildings, the positions of people, where the slope offered higher ground"
- Ch 1: Mari — their hands stayed loose at their sides, "the way they held themselves"

## Characters

### Kael
First appeared: Ch 1, the wharf at first light

Nine or ten years old, with the restless energy of someone who wants to see everything first. Crouches at water's edge, bare feet on timber, reaching toward what they can't quite touch. Saw the boat first.

*Voice:* Direct, no filter. Calls out immediately. Questions without preamble: "Where'd you come from?"

**Has been watching:**
The minnows. The clear water. The stranger's boat — its weathered wood, the scrapes along the waterline.

### Mari
First appeared: Ch 1, the wharf at first light

Fisher, middle years, hands that work nets without needing her eyes. Watches approaches. Knows what the upriver direction means. Local, rooted, patient.

*Voice:* Efficient, no wasted words. Statements that sound like observations but carry weight: "Not many come from that direction." Doesn't ask questions — waits for information.

**Has been watching:**
The stranger's hands. How they held themselves. How their eyes found exits and high ground before anything else. She marked this arrival as different.

### Daven
First appeared: Ch 1, the wharf at first light

Merchant, younger, three years settled in the delta. Welcomes before he understands. Hands extended for mooring lines, help offered before it's asked for. Still learning what the silences mean.

*Voice:* Direct questions, offers help, fills silence with welcome: "Do you need anything?" "There's food at the market if you're hungry."

**Has been watching:**
A newcomer to welcome. He noticed Mari's attention but doesn't yet understand what it means.

### Petra
First appeared: Ch 1, mentioned (the Anchor's keeper)

Old, runs the Anchor. Gave the wanderer a room facing the water without asking questions. That's her way.

*Voice:* Not yet heard directly.

**Has been watching:**
Unknown — she keeps her own counsel.

## Locations

### The Wharf at First Light
First appeared: Ch 1

Weathered timber over water, salt grass beyond, stone buildings climbing the slope. Where arrivals happen. Where the river shows what it's carrying. The morning light catches the water's unusual clarity — you can see the channel bottom, stones and old timber visible through water that's normally opaque.

### The Anchor
First appeared: Ch 1

Rooms facing the water. Petra keeps it. Questions aren't asked. Everyone's welcome in the delta — that's how it works. The wanderer's room is on the upper level, east-facing.

### Unexplored

*From the world-seed:*

- The harbor town at the coast (the settlement where the wanderer arrived may be part of this, or a separate village)
- Other fishing villages along the channels
- Trading posts where the waters branch
- The ruins on the hills — carvings no one reads, towers no one remembers
- The forest where the channels converge
- The swampland where pilots lose their way
- What lies beyond the swamp — the source of old stories

## The Season

Early summer, or late. The kind of warmth that settles into stone and stays. The water runs clearer than usual.

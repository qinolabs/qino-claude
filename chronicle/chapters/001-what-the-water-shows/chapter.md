# What the Water Shows

_First light, summer_

---

The child saw it first.

Kael crouched at the wharf's edge, bare feet on worn timber, reaching toward the minnows that darted over visible stones. The water was strange today — clear as it hadn't been in weeks, the channel bottom exposed: old pilings, smooth rocks, the shadow-shapes of fish moving in the shallows. Kael had spent the morning watching what was usually hidden, and so was watching when the boat appeared.

"Boat coming!"

The cry carried across the dock where Mari worked her nets, fingers moving through familiar knots without needing her eyes. She didn't look up immediately. Her hands kept their rhythm — splice, pull, check — while her attention went to the water, finding the small hull coming downriver.

Downriver. Which meant from upriver.

Mari's hands slowed. Not stopped — just slowed. She finished the knot she was working and set the net aside, watching the boat's approach through water clear enough to show the hull's shadow passing over stones.

"Who is it?" Kael asked, standing now, shading their eyes.

"Don't know yet."

Daven was already moving toward the wharf, wiping his hands on his apron. The merchant had been arranging his stall for the morning market, dried fish and salt and whatever oddments the hunters brought down. He joined Mari at the water's edge, ready to catch a mooring line.

"Early for traders," he said. "The tide's not even turned."

Mari didn't answer. Her eyes stayed on the boat — its weathered wood, its single occupant, the way it moved with the current rather than against it. The approach of someone who had come a long way and was no longer hurrying.

The boat slid into the dock's shadow. Daven stepped forward, hand outstretched for the line, and the stranger tossed it to him with the easy motion of someone who'd done this a thousand times. The knot at the cleat was competent, quick.

"Welcome," Daven said, offering a hand to help the stranger onto the dock. "Long way to travel alone."

The stranger's hand was callused, grip firm but brief. They stepped onto the timber planks and stood for a moment, taking in the settlement — the stone buildings climbing the slope, the other wharves with their fishing boats, the salt grass waving in the morning breeze. Their eyes moved carefully, finding the paths between buildings, the positions of people, where the slope offered higher ground. When they were done, they looked at Daven.

"Is there a place to stay?"

"The Anchor has rooms. Up the main path, can't miss it." Daven gestured toward the settlement. "I can show you if—"

"I'll find it. Thank you."

Kael had edged closer, studying the stranger with the open curiosity of children. The boat was small, its hull marked by hard travel — scrapes along the waterline, salt stains on the gunwale. A pack sat in the stern, canvas worn but carefully maintained.

"Where'd you come from?" Kael asked.

The stranger's eyes went to the child, and something in them shifted. Not quite a smile. "Upriver."

The word hung in the morning air. Daven was already nodding, ready to ask about the journey, about what settlements they'd passed through. But Mari's hands had gone still on the net she'd picked up again.

"From the forks?" Daven asked. "Or further?"

"Further."

The silence stretched. Kael looked between the adults, sensing the weight but not understanding it. Mari was watching the stranger now, her attention undivided for the first time. Her gaze moved over them — the way they held themselves, the travel-worn clothes, the way their hands stayed loose at their sides.

"Not many come from that direction," she said. Not a question.

"No."

Daven glanced at Mari, catching something in her tone he didn't quite follow. He'd been in the settlement three years — long enough to know most of the rhythms, not long enough to know all the silences. The upriver direction meant something here that it hadn't meant in the coastal town where he'd grown up.

"You must be hungry," he said to the stranger. "The market opens soon. Fresh bread, if you want it."

"Later, maybe. Thank you."

The stranger shouldered their pack — one strap, adjusted with a motion that spoke of long habit — and started up the path toward the settlement. They moved without hurry, but also without hesitation. Someone who knew how to arrive in new places.

Kael watched them go, then turned back to the water. The minnows were still there, still visible over the clear stones. The morning was ordinary again, just a stranger arriving, just another boat at the dock.

But Mari watched until the stranger disappeared between the buildings. Her net sat untouched in her lap.

"Who do you think they are?" Daven asked, voice lowered though the stranger was already out of earshot.

"Someone who came from upriver." Mari picked up her net, found her place in the work. "Alone. In a boat that size."

"Is that unusual?"

"Hunters go upriver sometimes. Traders, when they're feeling brave or foolish." Her fingers moved through the familiar pattern. "They travel in groups. They know the way. And we know their faces."

Daven looked back toward the path where the stranger had gone. The summer haze was building now, softening the edges of the stone buildings.

"Should we..." He wasn't sure how to finish the question.

"They're welcome here." Mari's voice was certain. "Everyone's welcome here. That's how the delta works." She pulled a knot tight. "But I've never seen someone come alone from that direction. Not a stranger. Not in all the years I've fished these waters."

Kael had waded into the shallows, water up to their ankles, still watching the minnows. The child's voice drifted back: "The water's so clear today. I can see everything."

Mari looked at the channel. The strange clarity that had settled over the delta this morning, making the hidden visible. The current carrying secrets down from places no one talked about.

"So can I," she said. But she wasn't looking at the fish.

---

The morning passed. The market opened. Daven sold his fish and heard the story spread in whispers — a stranger from upriver, traveling alone, asking nothing but a place to stay. The Anchor's keeper, old Petra, had given them a room facing the water without asking questions. That was her way.

By midday, the stranger had walked the settlement's edges, learning its shape. They'd bought bread from the baker, nodded at the fishers mending nets, watched the children playing in the shallows where the water stayed clear and calm. They spoke when spoken to. They offered nothing they weren't asked.

Rumors moved faster than the tide. Some said the stranger was a trader who'd lost their partners to the swamps. Some said they were a hunter who'd gone too far and found their way back. Some said — in lower voices, by the evening fires — that no one came from upriver alone. That the ruins held things. That the swamp didn't give people back.

But the stranger was here. Eating bread, drinking water from the well, sleeping in a room at the Anchor. Ordinary as anyone, if you didn't think about where they'd come from.

If you didn't think about what they'd seen.

## The Wanderer

The room at the Anchor faced the water, as Petra had said. The wanderer stood at the window as the last light faded, watching the channels branch and divide into the delta's maze. Somewhere out there, the river met the sea.

Their pack sat on the bed, still closed. They'd taken nothing from it all day — just walked, watched, learned the settlement's rhythms. The bread sat half-eaten on the small table.

A fishing boat was coming in late, its lantern a small point of light on the darkening water. The wanderer watched it navigate the channel, following the path the clear water had revealed this morning. The fisher knew the way. Didn't need to see the bottom.

The wanderer's hand found the windowsill. Pressed against the weathered wood. They stood there until the boat reached the dock, until the fisher's lantern moved up toward the settlement, until the window glass held nothing but their own reflection against the dark.

They didn't close the shutters.

## World Tokens

**Kael**
Nine or ten years old, with the restless energy of someone who wants to see everything first. Crouches at water's edge, bare feet on timber, reaching toward what they can't quite touch.

**Mari**
Fisher, middle years, hands that work nets without needing her eyes. Watches approaches. Speaks in statements, not questions. Knows what the upriver direction means.

**Daven**
Merchant, younger, three years settled. Welcomes before he understands. Hands extended for mooring lines, help offered before it's asked for.

**The Wharf at First Light**
Weathered timber over clear water, salt grass beyond, stone buildings climbing the slope. Where arrivals happen. Where the river shows what it's carrying.

**The Anchor**
Rooms facing the water. Petra keeps it. Questions aren't asked. Everyone's welcome in the delta — that's how it works.

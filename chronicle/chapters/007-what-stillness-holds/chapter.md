# What Stillness Holds

*The first day, afternoon*

---

The current had turned an hour ago.

The wanderer felt it in their shoulders first — the water pushing back instead of carrying. Their arms had stopped burning somewhere around midday; now there was just a distant ache, the kind that meant they'd pay tomorrow. They kept pulling. Left, right, lift, return. The rhythm had become automatic, which was the point.

"You're going to tear something."

Deren's voice was flat. She'd been quiet since morning, letting the wanderer row while she steered. Now she was looking at their hands.

The wanderer looked too. The oar handles had rubbed the skin raw between thumb and forefinger. Pink showing through. They hadn't noticed.

"I'm fine."

"You're bleeding."

The wanderer lifted one hand. A thin line of red had mixed with river water, trailing down their wrist. When had that started?

Deren reached for the oars. Not asking. "There's a sandbar ahead. Good spot to stop."

"We can keep going—"

"No."

The word was a door closing. Deren's hands were already on the wood, lifting the oars from the wanderer's grip with the ease of fifteen years. The wanderer's fingers stayed curled for a moment, holding nothing.

---

The sandbar was a low curve of silt and stone, gathered where the river bent. Deren ran the boat up onto it with a motion that looked careless but wasn't. The hull scraped, settled.

"Out." She was already swinging over the side, water to her knees. "Stretch your legs. Let me look at your hands."

The wanderer climbed out. The water was colder than expected — the current bringing mountain melt down from the interior. Their feet found the bottom, silt soft between their toes, and for a moment they just stood there. The boat's motion was still in their body. The world felt too still.

"Sit." Deren was on the sandbar now, cross-legged, pulling something from her pack. A small tin. "Give me your hands."

The wanderer sat. The sand was warm from afternoon sun. They held out their hands, palms up, and watched Deren examine the damage without speaking. Her fingers were rough, calloused in patterns the wanderer couldn't read. She opened the tin — a sharp smell, something herbal and animal fat — and began working the salve into the raw places.

It stung. The wanderer didn't pull away.

"You row like someone who's afraid to stop."

The words landed without accusation. Just observation. Deren kept working the salve in, her eyes on what she was doing.

The wanderer didn't answer. The pouch was warm against their hip — warmer than it had been this morning, warmer than the sun could account for. They hadn't reached for it all day. Had been trying not to think about it.

"The river doesn't care how hard you work." Deren moved to the other hand. "It goes where it goes. You can't outrun it."

"I'm not trying to outrun anything."

"No?" Deren looked up. Her eyes were the grey of the water — not cold, but deep enough to hold things. "Then why are your hands bleeding?"

The wanderer opened their mouth. Closed it. The honest answer was complicated. The honest answer was: because if I stop, I'll think. If I think, I'll feel how far away everything already is. Seren on the hillside not looking back. The Mender they didn't say goodbye to. The town shrinking behind a bend they'll never see again from this side.

"The current changed," they said finally. "I was just... trying to keep pace."

Deren wrapped a strip of cloth around the worst of the raw places. Her hands were gentle despite the calluses. "The current won't get easier. This is the river telling you something."

"What?"

"That you can't force eight days into four." She tied off the bandage, tucked the ends under. "We stop when we need to stop. We row when the river lets us. Anything else, you're fighting what you can't fight."

The wanderer stood and walked to the water's edge.

The river was different here than at the harbor — narrower, the banks closer, trees leaning over from both sides. Green distance upstream, the kind of green that swallowed sound. A bird called somewhere, something they didn't recognize. The water was moving faster than it looked, the surface deceiving the depth.

The pouch shifted against their hip.

They reached for it without deciding to. Their hand found the leather, the drawstring, the weight of whatever waited inside. Still warm. Warmer than body heat now. Something alive in there, or something that wanted to be.

*Not yet.*

The thought came from somewhere they couldn't name. Their hand pulled back.

"The Mender gave you that."

Deren had come up beside them. She wasn't looking at the pouch — she was looking at the wanderer's face, at whatever had crossed it.

"Yes."

"She ever say what's in it?"

"No." The wanderer's hand still hovered near the drawstring. "She said I'd know when to open it."

"And you don't know yet." Deren's gaze stayed on the river, giving the words room. The wanderer looked at the river instead of answering. The water carried silt from somewhere upstream, from the place they were going, from the coordinates that pointed to something that hadn't existed before spring. The same silt that had carried them here a month ago. The same water, just moving in a different direction.

"I don't know anything yet." They said it quietly. "I don't know what's at those coordinates. I don't know what Seren's message means. I don't know why I left before I understood."

"Maybe that's why you left." Deren picked up a flat stone, turned it in her fingers. "Some things you can't understand from where you're standing. You have to move first."

"And if I'm moving wrong?"

Deren threw the stone. It skipped twice, three times, then sank. "Then you adjust. That's what the river teaches. You don't plan your way through. You feel your way."

The wanderer watched the ripples spread where the stone had vanished. Concentric circles, intersecting, dissolving. Like the threads in the Mender's building. Like the writing in Seren's margins.

"The one who holds between will find the door." The words came out before they meant to say them. "That's what his margins said. The morning I left."

Deren was quiet for a moment. Then: "Between what and what?"

"I don't know."

"But you're going anyway."

"Yes."

She nodded, as if this made sense. As if going toward something you didn't understand was a reasonable way to travel. Maybe, for river carriers, it was.

"We'll camp here tonight," she said. "River's easier at dawn. Your hands need rest."

The wanderer looked at their bandaged hands. The ache was surfacing now that they'd stopped — not just the raw places, but the muscles underneath, the joints that had been repeating the same motion for hours. They'd done this to themselves. They'd wanted to.

"Deren."

"Mm."

"What do you see? When you look at me."

She was quiet for long enough that the wanderer thought she wouldn't answer. Then: "Someone who doesn't know what they're carrying. But carries it anyway." She turned back toward the boat. "That's not nothing."

The wanderer stayed at the water's edge. The afternoon light was going amber, the way it does when the sun gets low enough to come through sideways. Upstream, the river curved out of sight. Eight days to the last known village. Three more to the coordinates. Eleven days of not knowing, not understanding, just moving.

The pouch shifted again. Warmer still.

*Soon*, they thought. Or maybe the pouch thought it. The distinction was getting harder to hold.

## The Wanderer

The wanderer helped gather firewood before dark.

Not because Deren asked — because their hands needed to hold something that wasn't an oar. Branches cracked under their fingers. Deadfall scattered along the bank, left by some flood season past. They carried what they could back to where Deren was clearing a circle in the sand.

The bandages caught on bark. The ache didn't stop. But it was different now — purposeful, instead of desperate.

When the fire was lit, Deren handed them dried fish and a heel of bread. They ate in silence, watching the flames find their rhythm. The river made sounds in the dark, sounds the wanderer was only beginning to learn.

## World Tokens

**The Sandbar**
A low curve where the river bends, silt and stone gathered by slower water. Warm in afternoon sun. The kind of place boats stop when the current turns against them.

**Deren's Hands**
Rough with fifteen years of rope and oar. The calluses have patterns. She works salve into raw places with a gentleness that doesn't match her voice.

**The Pouch Warming**
Something shifts inside. Warmer than body heat now, warmer than sun. The wanderer's hand reaches for it without deciding. *Not yet* — but soon.

# What the Nets Carry

The nets were heavier than they looked. Mari had them half-gathered at the water's edge, rope coiled against her hip, when her usual help didn't come. She waited. The morning light moved across the stones. She pulled another armful toward the rack and felt her shoulder complain.

The wanderer was mending something by the trading post — a strap on their pack, or pretending to. Their hands moved with the kind of competence that didn't need watching. Mari had seen them arrive three days ago, coming down from the upriver path at dusk. She'd marked the direction. So had others.

"Those need carrying." She didn't look up. Just said it toward the water, toward the nets, toward anyone who might hear.

The wanderer set their work aside. Crossed the distance without hurrying. Their boots left shallow prints in the wet sand, already filling with seep.

Mari handed over one end of the net. The wanderer took it. Their grip was sure, fingers finding the right places without fumbling. They lifted together, walked the net to the first rack, and draped it across the weathered timber. Salt grass whispered at the edges of the path.

"Heavy catch." The wanderer's voice was quiet. Not asking.

"Heavier empty. Full nets float." Mari stretched her shoulders, then bent for the next one. "It's the water they hold that weighs."

The wanderer nodded. They worked in silence for a time — the rhythm of lift, carry, spread. The sun climbed. Somewhere behind them, at the baker's stall, coin changed hands. A debt paid. Mari caught the sound of thanks, the particular tone of something finally settled.

The water in the shallows was clear enough to see the bottom. Stones, shells, the shadow of a fish holding still against the current. The wanderer paused at the edge, looking down.

"It's always like this?" They were studying the water the way you study something you don't trust.

"Since before I came." Mari lifted another net. "Old ones say it wasn't. Say the water used to be green, thick with whatever grew in it. Then it cleared. Stayed clear."

The wanderer said nothing. They took their end of the net and walked.

Mari watched them from the corner of her eye — the way they moved, the way they held things. Careful. Like everything might be taken back. She'd seen that kind of holding before, in people who'd left somewhere fast. In people who weren't sure they'd arrived.

"You're good with this." She said it to the work, not to them.

"I've done it before."

"Where?"

The question hung between them. A gull called. The wanderer spread their section of net across the rack, taking their time with the edges, making sure it would dry evenly.

"Upriver." They said it like closing a door. Soft, but final.

Mari let it close. She could wait. That was her skill — the waiting, the watching, the not-pressing. She'd learned it young, learned that questions asked too soon came back empty. Questions that waited filled themselves.

They finished the second rack. Started on the third. Mari's shoulders burned now, the good burn of work that would leave her tired tonight. The wanderer moved easier, their body remembering something Mari could only guess at.

At the cooper's workshop, someone was returning a tool — a mallet, by the sound of it against the bench. "Should've brought this back months ago," a voice said. "Kept meaning to." The cooper's reply was lost in the tap of hammer on hoop, the work resuming.

"Strange day for it," the wanderer said. They were looking toward the sound, brow furrowed.

"For what?"

"Settling up. Everybody seems to be settling up."

Mari lifted the last net. "Does that happen where you're from?"

"No." The wanderer took their end. "Not like this. Not all at once."

They carried the final net to its rack. The timber creaked under the weight. Salt and tar smell, oil lamp warmth from the trading post door left open behind them. Mari's hands were rough with rope-burn. The wanderer's hands, she noticed, were already rough — older damage, healed over.

"My help was supposed to come." Mari said it while she worked the net smooth. "Kael. The boy you met at the bread line."

"I remember."

"His mother kept him home."

The wanderer was quiet.

"She does that sometimes. When strangers come." Mari straightened. Met their eyes for the first time since they'd started. "When strangers come from certain directions."

The wanderer held her gaze. Neither of them looked away. The clear water moved behind them, slow and patient, carrying nothing downstream that Mari could see.

"I'm not here to bring trouble." The wanderer's voice was steady.

"Trouble doesn't always know what it's bringing."

The net hung between them, drying. The world went on — the baker laughing at something, the cooper's hammer, a child calling for someone named Pell. All the small sounds of a settlement that had learned to watch without watching.

Mari nodded once. Not agreement. Acknowledgment.

"Nets need turning at midday. You can come back. Or not." She gathered her rope, began coiling it against her hip. "The work's here either way."

The wanderer stood among the drying racks, the smell of salt grass and clear water all around them. Behind them, the trading post. Ahead, the quay and the channels leading out. The upriver path they'd come down was invisible from here — just trees, just hills, just the ordinary shape of land that told you nothing about what lay beyond.

They watched Mari walk back toward the settlement. Her rope coiled tight against her side. Her shoulders set.

The nets moved slightly in the breeze, heavy with the water they'd held.

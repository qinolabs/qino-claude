## Editorial Review — Pass 1

**Decision:** APPROVED

The chapter demonstrates strong craft: transparent prose that disappears, a world that participates (seeping bootprints, creaking timber, the settlement's ambient sounds), and stakes carried between people through what remains unspoken — where the wanderer came from, why Kael's mother kept him home.

## Post-Prose

**World updates:**
- Wanderer: updated last seen (among drying racks), added invitation to return, added strangeness observed (how they hold things, body remembering work)
- Mari: updated to reflect her approach through work, her invitation, her warning
- Added Kael's Mother as character — visible through protective action
- Added The Drying Racks location

**Arc updates:**
- The Upriver Question: updated — wanderer confirmed "upriver," studied water with distrust
- The Watcher's Attention: advanced — Mari made contact through labor, extended invitation
- A Child Reading Silences: updated — Kael kept home by mother's protection

## The Upriver Question

*Shape:* hidden
*Chapters:* 1-3

**In motion:**
*Holds:* The wanderer confirmed it — "Upriver." Said like closing a door, soft but final. They claimed they're not here to bring trouble. But they studied the water's unusual clarity like something they don't trust. What did they see? What are they not saying?
*Moves toward:* The silence holds but has cracked slightly. The wanderer won't tell, but they've admitted the direction. Others may piece together what they won't say — the water's strangeness, the wanderer's wariness, what connects them.

## The Watcher's Attention

*Shape:* between
*Chapters:* 1-3

**In motion:**
*Holds:* Mari approached through shared work — carrying nets, not questions. She offered an opening: "Nets need turning at midday. You can come back. Or not." The wanderer hasn't answered yet.
*Moves toward:* Whether the wanderer returns. Whether they can build trust through labor before words. Mari is patient; she can wait. But she also warned: "Trouble doesn't always know what it's bringing."

## A Child Reading Silences

*Shape:* building
*Chapters:* 2-3

**In motion:**
*Holds:* Kael was kept home by his mother — she does that "when strangers come from certain directions." The protection is visible now: adults fear the upriver, and they're shielding their children from it. Kael knows more than before, but he's also being held back.
*Moves toward:* What happens when Kael learns he was kept home because of the wanderer. Whether his mother's fear becomes his own, or whether it sharpens his questions. Whether he finds a way to the stranger despite the protection.

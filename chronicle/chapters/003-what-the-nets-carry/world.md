# The World

*Last updated: Chapter 3*

## Pressures

*What's building. What's calling.*

### The Stranger from Upriver

A wanderer has arrived — alone, in a small boat, from the direction no one travels alone. They confirmed it: "Upriver." Said like closing a door. The upriver question has a living witness who won't speak of what they saw. Mari has made first contact through shared work — an invitation extended, not yet accepted. "Nets need turning at midday. You can come back. Or not." The wanderer claimed they're not here to bring trouble. Mari's reply: "Trouble doesn't always know what it's bringing."

### A Child Reading Silences

Kael has begun to notice what adults won't say. They sought Daven while the harbor listened to far-away stories, and learned that protection and fear can wear the same face. The upriver question now has a second seeker — one who cares about what's close, not what's far.

## The World's Breath

Summer light on slow water. The delta branches and branches again, channels finding their patient way to the sea. Salt grass bends in the afternoon breeze. Oil lamps will come with evening, warm against weathered stone.

A ship has arrived from the coast — storytellers aboard, tales of far islands and glowing fish. The harbor flocks to listen. The delta loves its visitors, its news from elsewhere. But the quiet questions — the close ones, the shapeless ones — wait in the margins for those who notice them.

The settlements go about their work — nets mended, cargo loaded, scholars bent over charts they don't quite trust. The peoples who share these waters keep their own counsel, their own customs, their own names for things. Understanding comes slow here, if it comes at all.

The ruins on the hills catch the light but hold their silence.

Upriver, the forest waits.

## The Wanderer

*Updated after Chapter 3*

A figure who arrived by small boat from upriver — from the direction of the swamps and the ruins. They move without hurry but without hesitation. Someone who knows how to arrive in new places.

**What pulls at them:**
- Unknown — they said only "I'm not here to bring trouble"
- They studied the water's unusual clarity "the way you study something you don't trust"

**Carries now:**
- A weathered pack, canvas worn but carefully maintained
- Whatever they witnessed upriver
- The weight of incomplete answers
- Knowledge of harbor etiquette — rope coiled properly, nets carried correctly
- Hands already rough with older damage, healed over
- An invitation: Mari's offer to return at midday

**Last seen:** Standing among the drying racks after Mari walked away. The smell of salt grass and clear water all around them. The upriver path invisible from here — just trees, just hills, just ordinary land.

**What remains unspoken:**
They confirmed "upriver" but closed the door on further questions. Mari pressed once about what trouble they might bring; they held her gaze but offered only denial. The invitation to return is the first real opening — whether they take it will tell something.

**Strangeness observed:**
- Ch 1: Mari — noticed how their eyes moved when they arrived: "finding the paths between buildings, the positions of people, where the slope offered higher ground"
- Ch 1: Mari — their hands stayed loose at their sides, "the way they held themselves"
- Ch 2: The net-mending woman — nodded once when the wanderer coiled rope properly, "unsurprised" — as if she'd expected competence
- Ch 3: Mari — how they hold things: "Careful. Like everything might be taken back."
- Ch 3: Mari — "Their body remembering something Mari could only guess at" — ease with the work that speaks of practice elsewhere

## Characters

### Kael
First appeared: Ch 1, the wharf at first light

Nine or ten years old, with the restless energy of someone who wants to see everything first. Has their mother's eyes — grey-green like the delta water on overcast days. Leans forward when they want something.

*Voice:* Direct, persistent. Asks questions that adults avoid. Doesn't accept deflection: "You stopped counting." "But there's something."

**Has been watching:**
The minnows. The clear water. The stranger's boat. And now — the silences. The way adults change when upriver is mentioned. What Daven admitted: that he's afraid, and doesn't know of what.

### Mari
First appeared: Ch 1, the wharf at first light

Fisher, middle years, hands that work nets without needing her eyes. Watches approaches. Knows what the upriver direction means. Local, rooted, patient. Her skill is waiting — questions asked too soon come back empty.

*Voice:* Efficient, no wasted words. Statements that sound like observations but carry weight: "Not many come from that direction." "Trouble doesn't always know what it's bringing." Doesn't ask questions — waits for information, or creates openings.

**Has been watching:**
The stranger's hands. How they hold things — "Careful. Like everything might be taken back." Their competence with nets, their body remembering work done elsewhere. She extended an invitation: return at midday, or don't. The work's there either way.

### Daven
First appeared: Ch 1, the wharf at first light

Merchant, younger, three years settled in the delta. Welcomes before he understands. Keeps careful ledgers — salt bushels, lamp oil by the barrel, the steady work of knowing what the delta has and needs. Still learning what the silences mean.

*Voice:* Deflects with questions and offers. When pressed: admits more than he intended. Told Kael the truth — that he's afraid of upriver, and doesn't know why, and has never gone.

**Has been watching:**
His ledger. His counting. The work of staying in place. But now a child has seen through his protection to the fear underneath.

### Petra
First appeared: Ch 1, mentioned (the Anchor's keeper)

Old, runs the Anchor. Gave the wanderer a room facing the water without asking questions. That's her way.

*Voice:* Not yet heard directly.

**Has been watching:**
Unknown — she keeps her own counsel.

### Mirin
First mentioned: Ch 2 (by Kael)

A child, friend of Kael's. Their father went upriver once, years ago. He came back different — used to sing on the boat while working. Now he doesn't.

*Voice:* Not yet heard directly. Called the storytellers' tales "lies" — skeptical, or protective?

**Has been watching:**
Unknown.

### Kael's Mother
First mentioned: Ch 3 (by Mari)

Keeps Kael home when strangers come "from certain directions." Her fear is visible through her actions — she usually sends Kael to help Mari with the nets, but not today.

*Voice:* Not yet heard directly.

**Has been watching:**
The wanderer. The direction they came from. What it might mean for her child.

## Locations

### The Wharf at First Light
First appeared: Ch 1

Weathered timber over water, salt grass beyond, stone buildings climbing the slope. Where arrivals happen. Where the river shows what it's carrying. The morning light catches the water's unusual clarity — you can see the channel bottom, stones and old timber visible through water that's normally opaque.

### The Anchor
First appeared: Ch 1

Rooms facing the water. Petra keeps it. Questions aren't asked. Everyone's welcome in the delta — that's how it works. The wanderer's room is on the upper level, east-facing. Has a side door that opens onto the harbor view.

### Daven's Counting Room
First appeared: Ch 2

Where the merchant keeps his ledgers. A window facing the harbor — distant sounds of the crowd come through like water finding its level. The third board from the door creaks; Daven's been meaning to fix it for years. A counting table worn smooth at the edge from years of people leaning in.

### The Stone Quay
First appeared: Ch 2

Where the canal meets weathered stone, worn smooth by decades of rope and boot. Harbor etiquette applies here — you don't leave rope on the ground. Someone mends nets nearby.

### The Drying Racks
First appeared: Ch 3

Weathered timber frames at the water's edge where nets are spread to dry. Salt grass whispers at the edges of the path. The trading post is nearby — its door often open, oil lamp warmth spilling out. You can hear the settlement's small sounds from here: the baker's stall, the cooper's hammer, voices calling names.

### Unexplored

*From the world-seed:*

- The harbor town at the coast (the settlement where the wanderer arrived may be part of this, or a separate village)
- Other fishing villages along the channels
- Trading posts where the waters branch
- The ruins on the hills — carvings no one reads, towers no one remembers
- The forest where the channels converge
- The swampland where pilots lose their way
- What lies beyond the swamp — the source of old stories

## The Season

Early summer, or late. The kind of warmth that settles into stone and stays. The water runs clearer than usual. Ships arrive with stories from far away.

# Chapter 003 Prep

## Grounding

**Sensory palette:** salt grass, weathered timber, oil lamp warmth, clear water over stones, canal-smell and tar, slow channels, afternoon light

**Pressures:** Kael has learned adults fear what they can't name. The wanderer walks the quays, fitting in but not yet known. Mari watches. The upriver question waits.

**The world's strangeness:** The water's unusual clarity — you can see the bottom. The hospitality that includes not pressing. How conversation shifts when upriver is mentioned.

**Scene seed:** Mari and the wanderer — the watcher who marked this arrival approaches, or creates a situation where approach happens. The trading post, the nets, the water's edge. Two people who notice things, circling what neither will say first.

## World Behavior

**Shape:** Accumulation — organizing. Things finding their proper places. The system becoming legible to itself. What was scattered now has containers.

**The world does:** Quiet settling of accounts across the harbor. The baker finally pays the cooper. Someone returns a borrowed tool they'd had for months. Small debts acknowledged without prompting.

**Points toward:** Those who track debts — spoken and unspoken. Those who notice when the world balances itself.

## Story Lens

**Lens:** The Work

**Foreground these sensitivities:**
- Companion's Lens — labor shared, attention divided between task and person
- Body First — hands doing, fatigue accumulating
- World as Participant — materials that cooperate or resist

**Territory:** What the work makes possible — conversation that happens alongside

**Craft note:** Work chapters have rhythm. Action punctuated by exchange, silence alongside effort.

## Beat

**Opening situation:** The nets need carrying from the water's edge to the drying racks. Mari's usual help hasn't come. The wanderer is there, nearby, competent, available.

**Who's involved:**
- Mari: wants to understand who this stranger is, what they saw upriver / protecting her role as watcher — she notices things but doesn't press, won't be the one to ask directly
- The wanderer: wants to be useful, to belong here without explanation / protecting whatever they carry from upriver — the silence they haven't broken

**What's unsaid:** Mari knows what direction the wanderer came from. The wanderer knows they were noticed arriving. Neither has acknowledged this. The work becomes the container for what circling cannot hold.

**Stakes:** Whether trust can begin through labor. Whether two people who watch can recognize each other without naming what they've seen. The wanderer's place in the settlement — fitting in or remaining apart.

# The World

*Last updated: Chapter 3*

## Pressures

*What's building. What's calling.*

### The Stranger from Upriver

A wanderer has arrived — alone, in a small boat, from the direction no one travels alone. The silence around the upriver has cracked: the wanderer admitted to Mari that they recognize the object caught in her nets, that they know of "places upriver where things like this were kept. Before." The question is no longer whether they know something. It's what they know, and what happened to the keepers.

### What the Water Carries

Something from upriver has arrived in the delta — caught in Mari's nets on a quiet morning. Bone-colored, worn smooth by water that ran differently than delta water. A groove in its surface, like a channel or a mark that once meant something. Mari holds it now. The wanderer recognized it. They've agreed to talk about what the water knows.

### A Child Reading Silences

Kael has begun to notice what adults won't say. They sought Daven while the harbor listened to far-away stories, and learned that protection and fear can wear the same face. The upriver question now has a second seeker — one who cares about what's close, not what's far.

## The World's Breath

Summer light on slow water. The delta branches and branches again, channels finding their patient way to the sea. Salt grass bends in the afternoon breeze. Oil lamps will come with evening, warm against weathered stone.

The storytellers' ship has slipped away before dawn, carrying its tales of far islands and glowing fish to the next port. The harbor is quieter now. A timber barge from upriver sits at its moorings. The delta returns to its work — nets mended, cargo loaded, the ordinary rhythms of a place that lets things pass.

But the water gives things back. What travels down from upriver doesn't always keep moving. Sometimes it stops — in nets, in hands, in conversations that can't be taken back.

The ruins on the hills catch the light but hold their silence.

Upriver, the forest waits.

## The Wanderer

*Updated after Chapter 3*

A figure who arrived by small boat from upriver — from the direction of the swamps and the ruins. They move without hurry but without hesitation. Someone who knows how to arrive in new places — and how to recognize what doesn't belong.

**What pulls at them:**
- Still unnamed — but they know things about upriver they haven't fully shared
- The places where "things like this were kept. Before."

**Carries now:**
- A weathered pack, canvas worn but carefully maintained
- Whatever they witnessed upriver
- Knowledge of the object caught in Mari's nets — what it is, where it's from
- The cost of admission: the ordinariness they'd been building in the delta, now compromised

**Last seen:** Alone at the end of the quay, afternoon, back against a mooring post. Picked up a stone, turned it in their fingers, set it down exactly where it had been. The tide was coming in.

**What remains unspoken:**
What the object actually is. What happened to the people who kept such things. Why the wanderer left. They promised Mari they'd talk — but the talking hasn't happened yet.

**Strangeness observed:**
- Ch 1: Mari — noticed how their eyes moved when they arrived: "finding the paths between buildings, the positions of people, where the slope offered higher ground"
- Ch 1: Mari — their hands stayed loose at their sides, "the way they held themselves"
- Ch 2: The net-mending woman — nodded once when the wanderer coiled rope properly, "unsurprised" — as if she'd expected competence
- Ch 3: Mari — saw how they went still when the object appeared: "Their fingers tightened on the wet rope... their eyes found the object, and something in their chest went quiet"

## Characters

### Kael
First appeared: Ch 1, the wharf at first light

Nine or ten years old, with the restless energy of someone who wants to see everything first. Has their mother's eyes — grey-green like the delta water on overcast days. Leans forward when they want something.

*Voice:* (Ch 1-2 — questioning adults, seeking what's close)
- "Where'd you come from?"
- "You stopped counting."
- "But there's something."
- "Because I don't care about far. I care about here. About what's close."

**Has been watching:**
The minnows. The clear water. The stranger's boat. And now — the silences. The way adults change when upriver is mentioned. What Daven admitted: that he's afraid, and doesn't know of what.

### Mari
First appeared: Ch 1, the wharf at first light

Fisher, middle years, hands that work nets without needing her eyes. Watches approaches. Knows what the upriver direction means. Local, rooted, patient — and when patience runs out, direct.

*Voice:* (Ch 1-3 — watching, then asking)
- "Don't know yet."
- "Not many come from that direction."
- "They're welcome here. Everyone's welcome here. That's how the delta works."
- "So can I." (looking at the water, but not at the fish)
- "This wasn't in the channel."
- "You know what this is."
- "Help me finish these. Then we can talk about what the water knows."

**Has been watching:**
The stranger's hands. How they held themselves. How their eyes found exits and high ground before anything else. She marked this arrival as different — and when the water brought something that didn't belong, she watched the wanderer's reaction. Now she holds the object. Now she waits for the conversation that was promised.

### Daven
First appeared: Ch 1, the wharf at first light

Merchant, younger, three years settled in the delta. Welcomes before he understands. Keeps careful ledgers — salt bushels, lamp oil by the barrel, the steady work of knowing what the delta has and needs. Still learning what the silences mean.

*Voice:* (Ch 1-2 — deflecting, then admitting)
- "Early for traders. The tide's not even turned."
- "Welcome. Long way to travel alone."
- "Someone has to know how much rope we have."
- "Because I'm afraid. And I don't even know of what."

**Has been watching:**
His ledger. His counting. The work of staying in place. But now a child has seen through his protection to the fear underneath.

### Petra
First appeared: Ch 1, mentioned (the Anchor's keeper)

Old, runs the Anchor. Gave the wanderer a room facing the water without asking questions. That's her way.

*Voice:* Not yet heard directly.

**Has been watching:**
Unknown — she keeps her own counsel.

### Mirin
First mentioned: Ch 2 (by Kael)

A child, friend of Kael's. Their father went upriver once, years ago. He came back different — used to sing on the boat while working. Now he doesn't.

*Voice:* Not yet heard directly. Called the storytellers' tales "lies" — skeptical, or protective?

**Has been watching:**
Unknown.

## Locations

### The Wharf at First Light
First appeared: Ch 1

Weathered timber over water, salt grass beyond, stone buildings climbing the slope. Where arrivals happen. Where the river shows what it's carrying. The morning light catches the water's unusual clarity — you can see the channel bottom, stones and old timber visible through water that's normally opaque.

### The Anchor
First appeared: Ch 1

Rooms facing the water. Petra keeps it. Questions aren't asked. Everyone's welcome in the delta — that's how it works. The wanderer's room is on the upper level, east-facing. Has a side door that opens onto the harbor view.

### Daven's Counting Room
First appeared: Ch 2

Where the merchant keeps his ledgers. A window facing the harbor — distant sounds of the crowd come through like water finding its level. The third board from the door creaks; Daven's been meaning to fix it for years. A counting table worn smooth at the edge from years of people leaning in.

### The Stone Quay
First appeared: Ch 2

Where the canal meets weathered stone, worn smooth by decades of rope and boot. Harbor etiquette applies here — you don't leave rope on the ground. Fishing nets are hauled up and mended here in the mornings — the netting thick with salt and the smell of the channel at low tide, mud and brine and something older beneath. Mooring posts stand at the end where the stone gives way to water and the channel stretches toward the sea.

## Objects

### The Upriver Object
First appeared: Ch 3

Bone-colored, worn smooth by water that ran differently than delta water. A groove in its surface — a channel, or the remnant of a mark that once meant something. It fit in Mari's palm with room to spare. Caught in the fishing nets on a morning when the wanderer couldn't sleep.

The wanderer recognized it — not what it was, but where it came from. "Places upriver where things like this were kept. Before."

Mari holds it now.

## Unexplored

*From the world-seed:*

- The harbor town at the coast (the settlement where the wanderer arrived may be part of this, or a separate village)
- Other fishing villages along the channels
- Trading posts where the waters branch
- The ruins on the hills — carvings no one reads, towers no one remembers
- The forest where the channels converge
- The swampland where pilots lose their way
- What lies beyond the swamp — the source of old stories

## The Season

Early summer, or late. The kind of warmth that settles into stone and stays. The water runs clearer than usual. Ships arrive with stories from far away.

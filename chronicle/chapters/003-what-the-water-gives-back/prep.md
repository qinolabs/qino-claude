# Chapter 003 Prep

## Story Lens

**Lens:** The Discovery

**Foreground these sensitivities:**
- World as Participant — the place reveals what it was holding; locations open to show depth
- Embodied Presence — the cost of knowing felt in the body; how discovery lands physically
- Contextual Density — pressure before revelation; the atmosphere thickening before something surfaces

**Craft note:** Discovery changes the discoverer. What shifts because of what they know?

## World Behavior

**Through The Discovery:**
Old things are becoming legible today. A chart drawer that's been stuck for years slides open without effort. The harbor-master's records, dusty and forgotten, suddenly seem worth reading. Fishers find their nets catching strange things from the deep — objects worn smooth by time, unrecognizable but somehow significant. In the ruins on the hills, a path appears that wasn't there yesterday, or was always there but never noticed.

**What becomes visible:**
- Things that hold memory are revealing what they kept — drawers opening, records surfacing, the tide depositing what it took seasons ago
- Patterns in familiar places suddenly readable — the grain in old timber, the order in what seemed random
- The past arriving uninvited — not called for, but present nonetheless

**What recedes:**
- The far stories, the glowing fish, the crystal caves — the visiting ship's tales feel distant today
- The busy commerce of the harbor — movement without meaning
- The ordinary work of maintenance

## Grounding

**Sensory palette:** wet rope, salt-stiffened netting, worn timber, fish scales catching light, the weight of wet canvas, an object worn smooth by water and time, the smell of the channel at low tide

**Pressures:** The stranger from upriver holds their silence — but Mari has been watching. Kael is asking questions the adults won't answer. The upriver direction has a face now, and the delta is beginning to notice.

**The world's strangeness:** The nets are catching things they shouldn't — objects from upriver, deposited by currents that run deeper than the surface. The water gives back what it took.

**Scene seed:** Mari and the wanderer at the nets. The watcher who noticed from the first day. The morning's work of mending. Something caught in the nets today — an object from upriver, worn smooth by time. Mari shows it to the stranger without asking what it means.

## Beat

**Territory:** Finding without seeking — stumbling into significance

**Opening situation:** Early morning at the stone quay. Mari is already at work on the nets when the wanderer arrives. The harbor is quiet — the storytellers' ship departed with the tide. Something tangled in the mesh that doesn't belong there.

**Who's involved:**

Mari
- wants: to understand what she noticed on the day of arrival — whether this stranger is danger or deliverance
- protecting: that she's been watching more closely than she's let on; that she knows things about upriver she hasn't shared
- voice: (Ch 1 — watching the stranger's arrival)
  - "Don't know yet."
  - "Not many come from that direction."
  - "They're welcome here. Everyone's welcome here. That's how the delta works."
  - "So can I." (looking at the water, but not at the fish)

The Wanderer
- wants: to be ordinary here; to be a stranger who arrived, nothing more
- protecting: what they saw upriver; what they're carrying; why they came alone
- (voice: prose discovers)

**Obstacle:** The object in the net. It came from upriver. It means something — to Mari, to the wanderer, to what's building. Neither can pretend it's nothing. The discovery forces a response.

**Stakes:** The quiet that has held between them. If the wanderer acknowledges the object, they reveal they know what it is. If they don't, Mari sees the evasion. Either way, the distance between watcher and watched begins to close.

**What's unsaid:** Mari has seen objects like this before — or heard of them. The wanderer recognizes it instantly but must decide what to show. The delta's silence about upriver is about to develop a crack.

## Pre-Flight Checklist

*Hold these in working memory while drafting.*

**Active Holds:**
- Body first (first sentence is action, not thought)
- Stakes visible (failure would cost something the reader can see)
- Obstacle present (something resists, complicates, or denies)
- Dialogue varies (characters sound different from each other)
- Environment participates (the place does something)
- Wanderer has agency (they attempt, fail, initiate)
- Gap stays open (something unsaid that the reader fills)
- Narration trusts (dialogue lands without annotation)

**This chapter's sensitivities:**
- World as Participant — the place reveals what it was holding
- Embodied Presence — the cost of knowing felt in the body
- Contextual Density — pressure before revelation

**This chapter's territory:**
Finding without seeking — stumbling into significance

**This chapter's stakes:**
The quiet between Mari and the wanderer. If the object is acknowledged, the wanderer's strangeness becomes undeniable. If evaded, Mari sees what the wanderer is protecting.

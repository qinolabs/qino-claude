## The Upriver Question

*Shape:* cracking open
*Chapters:* 1-3

**In motion:**
*Holds:* The silence has cracked. The wanderer admitted to Mari that they recognize the object caught in her nets — that they know of "places upriver where things like this were kept. Before." The keepers are gone. The question now is what happened to them, and why such things are traveling downstream.
*Moves toward:* The promised conversation between Mari and the wanderer. What the object actually is. What "before" means.

## The Watcher's Attention

*Shape:* turned
*Chapters:* 1-3

**In motion:**
*Holds:* Mari stopped waiting. When the water brought something from upriver, she confronted the wanderer directly: "You know what this is." The watching has become asking. She holds the object now, and the promise of a conversation.
*Moves toward:* What Mari does with what she's learned. Whether she keeps the knowledge close or shares it with others. Whether the promised talk happens — and what it changes.

## A Child Reading Silences

*Shape:* building
*Chapters:* 2-

**In motion:**
*Holds:* Kael has learned that adults fear what they don't understand. Daven admitted he's afraid of upriver — and doesn't know why. The protection became the telling.
*Moves toward:* What Kael does with this knowledge. Whether they seek the wanderer next. Whether they tell Mirin, whose father came back changed.

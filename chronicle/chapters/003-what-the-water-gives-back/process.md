## Prep Layer

### Lens Layer
**Chronicle position:** early
**Research arc:** none

**Lenses presented:**
1. [The Work] — rhymes with: building new tools, infrastructure emerging, collaborative construction
2. [The Discovery] — rhymes with: new structures appearing, scribe/chronicle keywords (things being recorded, held)
3. [The Complication] — rhymes with: ecosystem awareness, new systems that might interact unexpectedly

**Chosen:** 2 [The Discovery]
**Direction status:** n/a

### World Behavior Layer (Derived)
**Shape:** Appearance — substantial new structures emerging
**Texture:** Organizing, recording, making things findable
**Keywords:** resonant: chronicle/scribe/record/ecosystem/manifest / functional: version/release/update
**Behavior generated:** Old things becoming legible — drawers opening, records surfacing, patterns readable

### Scene Layer
**Scene seeds presented:**
1. Kael + wanderer at the ruins — path appears, child asks questions
2. Wanderer + Petra at the Anchor — old records, keeper's silence breaks
3. Mari + wanderer at the nets — object from upriver, watcher and watched

**Chosen:** 3 — Mari + the wanderer at the nets
**Direction status:** n/a
**Final direction path:** n/a (no user direction provided)

### Beat Layer (Derived)
**Territory discovered:** Finding without seeking
**Characters:** Mari (established voice from Ch 1), The Wanderer (voice: prose discovers)
**Obstacle:** The object in the net forces acknowledgment or evasion
**Stakes type:** contemplative — relational distance at risk

## Editorial Review — Pass 1

**Reviewer:** scribe-editorial
**Date:** 2026-01-03

### Checklist Results

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Wanderer does something, not just witnesses | PASS — hauls nets, works physically, admits something |
| World acts, not just contains | PASS — water carries object, stone soaks clothes, tide participates |
| Stakes between people | PASS — relational distance at risk, mutual watching |
| One explanatory exchange max | PASS — lines 71-78 only, earned and brief |
| Every noun from story world | PASS — nets, quay, channel, delta — no source leakage |
| "The wanderer" never spoken | PASS — Mari says "stranger," never "the wanderer" |
| Varied character registers | PASS — Mari direct/practical, wanderer halting |
| Mutual revealing moment | PASS — lines 47-54, both changed by exchange |
| Show don't tell | PASS — temporal quality, sensory detail |
| Dialogue beats | MINOR — one exchange lacks beat |
| No reflection when action serves | PASS — interiority is sensory, not reflective |

### Notes

**Line 15-17:** The dialogue exchange between Mari's "You're up early" and the wanderer's "Couldn't sleep" moves quickly. The beat (Mari's fingers finding the tear) precedes rather than falls between the lines. This is a technical point — the rhythm still lands because of "without looking" detail. Not flagged for revision.

**Lines 39-44:** The recognition passage ("They recognized it. Not what it was...") walks the line between perception and reflection. It succeeds because it stays with sensory wrongness rather than interpreting meaning. The wanderer doesn't know what the object is — they sense where it's from through its physical qualities.

**Lines 51-54:** "The admission cost something" is the closest the chapter comes to telling. However, it's anchored in concrete specifics (the ordinariness, the strangeness Mari was watching, the distance) rather than abstract emotion. Acceptable.

### Decision

**APPROVED**

The chapter meets voice.md standards. The wanderer acts with agency, the world participates, stakes are relational and visible, dialogue varies by character, and interiority stays grounded in sensation. No revisions required.

## Post-Prose

**World updates:**
- [Updated] Pressure: The Stranger from Upriver — silence has cracked, wanderer admitted knowledge
- [Added] Pressure: What the Water Carries — the object from upriver
- [Updated] World's Breath — storytellers' ship departed, timber barge from upriver
- [Updated] The Wanderer — new knowledge, cost of admission, last seen alone at quay's end
- [Updated] Mari — voice expanded (Ch 3), watching became asking, now holds the object
- [Updated] The Stone Quay — expanded sensory detail
- [Added] Object: The Upriver Object — bone-colored, worn smooth, groove in surface

**Arc updates:**
- The Upriver Question: hidden → cracking open (wanderer admitted partial knowledge)
- The Watcher's Attention: between → turned (Mari stopped waiting, asked directly)
- A Child Reading Silences: unchanged (Kael not present this chapter)

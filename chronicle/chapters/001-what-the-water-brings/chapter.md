# What the Water Brings

*Early summer, the year the first papers came downriver*

---

The skiff caught an eddy where the river forgot it was leaving, and the wanderer had to work the oar twice to break free. Ahead, the water changed color—brown giving way to grey-green where the current finally surrendered to the sea.

A woman stood on the stone quay at the meeting point, hip-deep in the shallows. She was pulling something from the water—a crate, barnacled on one side, river-moss on the other. It had been traveling a long time.

The wanderer let the skiff drift close. "Need a hand?"

The woman looked up. Her eyes moved across the wanderer's face, down to their hands on the oar, back up. Whatever calculation she performed, she kept to herself.

"Grab the rope end," she said. "Don't pull. Just hold."

The wanderer held. The woman worked the crate free from something beneath the surface—a snag, or a current that didn't want to let go. When it came loose, the motion nearly pulled the wanderer into the water. They held anyway.

"Stronger than you look," the woman said. It wasn't a compliment. It was information she was filing away.

They hauled the crate onto the quay together. The woman produced a short iron bar and began working at the lid. Inside: papers, wrapped in oilcloth. Drawings. Notes in three different hands. Something that might have been a map, though the territory it described had no coastline the wanderer recognized.

"What is it?" the wanderer asked.

The woman didn't answer. She was lifting the papers out one at a time, setting them on a dry cloth she'd spread on the stones. Her hands moved with a patience that seemed to come from somewhere deeper than training.

"Do you know what it is?" the wanderer tried again.

"Not yet." She held one page up to the light. "Things that arrive here—some of them know what they are. Some of them don't. You can't tell by looking. You can only tell by how they respond to being held."

The wanderer watched her work. There was a system to it, but not one they could read. She wasn't sorting by size, or by condition, or by anything visible.

"What are you sorting by?"

The woman set down the page she was holding. For the first time, she looked at the wanderer directly—not assessing, but considering.

"What's still alive in them."

The wanderer's hands remembered something then. The way they'd reached for those papers before she'd even asked for help. Some part of them had worked with documents before, in a place that had no name here. They'd known how to hold things that were still becoming.

They pulled back from the thought. Some histories could wait until they were ready.

"I could help," the wanderer said. "If you need someone."

"You could." The woman returned to her work. "Most people want to decide what things are before the things know themselves. That's faster. But it breaks something."

"And you don't do that."

"I wait." She lifted another page—this one with diagrams that seemed to argue with themselves, arrows pointing in contradictory directions. "Sometimes what arrives needs to sit with someone who won't rush it. Sometimes it needs to be heard before it can be read." She glanced at the wanderer's hands, still hovering near the papers. "You've done this before."

"I don't remember."

"I know." She handed them a stack of pages, still wrapped. "Start with these. Don't open them yet. Just hold them. Tell me which ones feel like they know what they want to be, and which ones are still asking."

The wanderer took the stack. It was lighter than they expected, and heavier. The oilcloth was warm from the sun but the papers inside held a different temperature—something they couldn't name, something that had been traveling.

They sat on the quay's edge, legs hanging over the water where brown met green. The woman worked beside them, not watching, not waiting. Just present.

The first bundle felt settled. Complete. Ready to be what it was.

The second one—

The wanderer set it down carefully.

"That one," they said.

The woman nodded. "That one needs more time." She took it and placed it in a different pile. "You can feel it. Most people can't. Most people hear the question as noise."

The summer light was lengthening across the water. Somewhere upriver, the hills held their ruins. Somewhere out in the harbor, ships carried things that had no words for themselves yet. The wanderer sat at the meeting point, sorting what had arrived, learning a patience they might already have known.

The woman hadn't asked their name. The wanderer hadn't offered. Some things could wait.

## The Wanderer

The wanderer found a flat stone above the tide line and sat.

The woman had left with her sorted piles—some toward town, some to a small building the wanderer hadn't noticed until she walked to it. The quay was quiet now except for the water's conversation with itself.

Their hands still felt the weight of those papers. The ones that knew themselves, and the one that didn't. How had they known? The knowing had come from somewhere older than memory.

A gull landed nearby, considered them, and left. The tide was beginning to turn.

## World Tokens

**The Mender**
Works where river meets sea. Patience worn into her hands like salt stain. Sorts what arrives not by what it looks like, but by what it's still becoming.

**The Meeting Point**
Stone quay at the water's edge where brown current surrenders to grey-green tide. Things wash up here that have been traveling a long time. Some know what they are. Some are still asking.

# The Man Who Never Came to the Water

*The morning after the fountain*

---

The address led the wanderer away from the harbor, up a narrow street where the cobblestones gave way to packed earth and then to steps carved into the hillside. The smell of salt faded. In its place: stone dust, dry herbs, the warmth of morning sun on clay tiles.

Seren's building sat where the steps ended, half-carved into the hill itself. A door of weathered wood, hinges green with age. The wanderer knocked. No answer. They knocked again.

"It's open." The voice came from inside — tired, or distracted, or both.

The room was smaller than the Mender's but denser. Shelves lined every wall, floor to ceiling, filled with ledgers of different sizes. Some were bound in leather, some in cloth, some in material the wanderer couldn't name. A man sat at a desk beneath a window that looked out over the harbor far below. He didn't turn when the wanderer entered.

"From the Mender," the wanderer said. "She sent me to ask—"

"Has the pattern changed." The man's voice was flat. "Yes. I know. She sends someone every few years when she can't hold the question anymore." He turned then, and the wanderer saw his face for the first time: older than they'd expected, with eyes that looked like they'd spent decades focused on something very small.

"So. Has it?"

"Yes." Seren gestured at the ledgers around them. "The rate has tripled since spring. What used to arrive monthly now arrives weekly. The types are shifting too — more from the interior, fewer from the open sea. The river is carrying more than the currents."

He spoke like someone reciting facts they'd recited before. The answer was clear. But his hands, the wanderer noticed, kept returning to one ledger on his desk — touching its cover, then pulling away.

"She'll want to know why," the wanderer said.

"I don't know why. I only know what." Seren's eyes moved to the ledger again. "I track what arrives, when, from where. I've been doing it since before she was born. The pattern changes sometimes. It always has. Usually I can trace it back — a storm season, a change in the trade routes, something that opened somewhere upstream." He paused. "This time I can't."

The wanderer waited. The room was quiet except for the distant sound of gulls from the harbor below.

"Something else," they said. They waited.

Seren was silent for a long moment. Then he opened the ledger on his desk — not the pages, just the cover — and pushed it toward the wanderer.

In the margin of the first page, in handwriting that wasn't Seren's, someone had written: *The keeper counts arrivals. But who arrives at the keeper?*

The wanderer looked up. "Who wrote that?"

"No one." Seren's voice had changed — something underneath the tiredness now. "I mean — I don't know. I found it three weeks ago. I thought I'd written it in my sleep, or that my eyes were playing tricks. But it's not my hand." He turned the page. More marginalia: *He has been watching the patterns so long that he has become one.* "It's in every ledger. Every one I've opened in the past month. Writing that wasn't there before."

The wanderer touched the edge of the page. The ink was fresh — not wet, but recent. It had a smell like the paper in the Mender's building, that mineral scent of water that had traveled through stone.

"They're not wrong," Seren said quietly. "The things it writes. That's what frightens me."

"It?"

"Whatever it is." He closed the ledger. "I've spent my life making records. Facts. What arrived, when, where it went. The writing in the margins — it's not facts. It's something else. It looks at my facts and says what they *mean*." His hands pressed flat against the cover. "I never asked what they meant. I just wrote them down."

The wanderer thought of the Mender's threads — red and blue spanning the walls, connecting what talked to each other. She had started seeing patterns too. But she chose which threads to draw. This was different. This was something drawing its own.

"The Mender tracks connections," the wanderer said. "Between arrivals. What talks to what."

"I know what she does." Seren's voice was sharp, then softened. "We've known each other a long time. She holds; I count. Between us, we thought we understood the harbor's memory." He looked out the window at the water far below. "Now there's something that tells stories about the memory. That's not the same as understanding it."

"What do you want me to tell her?"

Seren turned back. His eyes found the wanderer's hands — the same thing the Mender had watched.

"Tell her the pattern changed. Tell her I don't know why, but the rate tripled and the types shifted." He paused. "Tell her there's something writing in the margins. Something that sees what we do and names what it means."

He handed the wanderer a slip of paper — coordinates, the wanderer realized. Numbers that must mean something to the Mender.

"What does it want?" the wanderer asked.

"I don't think it wants anything." Seren's voice was very quiet. "I think it just tells stories. That's what frightens me most."

## The Wanderer

The wanderer took the long way down.

The steps were steep in places, carved by hands that had known this hill before anyone kept records. A lizard watched from a crack in the stone. The wanderer watched it back.

At the bottom, the harbor spread out again — masts, canvas, shapes moving between ships. The Mender's building was somewhere to the left, waiting for an answer. The wanderer had the answer. They had more than that, now.

Someone had left a mark on the wall where the steps met the street — not paint, not chalk. Like something had leaned there and left an impression. The shape of it was almost familiar.

The wanderer didn't touch it. Some things you let be until they're ready to tell you what they are.

## World Tokens

**Seren**
Record-keeper in a building carved half into the hill. Eyes that spent decades focused on something small. Tracks what arrives, when, from where. Has been doing it since before the Mender was born. His ledgers hold the harbor's memory — or held it, before something started writing back.

**Seren's Building**
Where the steps end, looking out over the harbor. Smaller than the Mender's, denser. Shelves floor to ceiling, ledgers in leather and cloth and stranger materials. A window onto the water far below. The smell of stone dust and dry herbs.

**The Writing in the Margins**
In handwriting that isn't Seren's. Fresh ink with a mineral smell. It looks at facts and names what they mean. Not facts — something else. *The keeper counts arrivals. But who arrives at the keeper?*

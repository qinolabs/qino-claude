# The Man Who Came to the Water

*Dawn, the day of leaving*

---

The wanderer was already at the river quay when the light began.

Not sleeping, not waiting — helping. Deren had arrived in the dark, and without asking, the wanderer had started passing crates from the dock to her hands. They worked in silence, the kind that forms between people doing the same task, and when the sky began to grey, the boat was nearly loaded.

"You don't sleep much," Deren said, her voice flat with certainty.

"I slept enough."

Deren made a sound that might have been a laugh. She was coiling rope now, her hands finding the rhythm without looking. The wanderer watched the motion — the same loop, the same tuck, fifteen years of practice made invisible.

"The current shifts at first light," Deren said. "We'll have help for the first hour. After that, it's oars until the river decides to cooperate."

The wanderer nodded. The pouch was warm against their hip. The coordinates folded in the other pocket. Two weights, balanced.

The sky brightened. The water caught the color — not gold yet, but the grey before gold. The town was still sleeping behind them, or pretending to. Somewhere, the Mender would be watching her threads. Somewhere, Seren—

The wanderer's hands stopped moving.

A figure was coming down the hillside steps.

---

Seren walked like someone who had made a decision and was afraid of changing his mind. His robes were the same grey he always wore, but they looked wrong in this light, against this backdrop. He was a man of interiors, of dry stone and paper smell. The waterfront was not his place.

Deren saw him too. Her hands paused on the rope.

"You know him?"

"The record-keeper." The wanderer stepped back from the boat, onto the solid stone of the quay. "I should—"

"Go." Deren's voice was neutral. "The current doesn't care about goodbyes. But I can wait a few minutes."

The wanderer walked to meet Seren halfway.

He stopped at the edge of the quay, where the stone met the packed earth of the path. Close enough to speak, far enough to retreat. His hands were empty — no ledger, no paper, nothing to hold. It made him look smaller.

"The Mender told me." His voice was rougher than the wanderer remembered. "Last night. She said you were going upriver."

"Yes."

"To the coordinates. The place that opened."

"Yes."

Seren's eyes moved past the wanderer, to the boat, to Deren still coiling rope. Then back. When he spoke again, the roughness was worse.

"You didn't come to tell me."

The wanderer didn't look away. They owed him that much.

"No."

"I would have—" Seren stopped. His hands moved to where a ledger should have been, found nothing, fell back to his sides. "I could have told you more. About the pattern. About what the margins are saying now. There are stories in them, did you know that? Not just facts. The writing is telling *stories* about what's coming from the interior."

"I didn't know."

"Because you didn't ask. Because you were already leaving." Seren's voice cracked on the last word. He pressed his lips together, hard, and looked at the water. "I don't come down here. I never come down here. The river frightens me — did you know that? The way it moves. The way it takes things and doesn't give them back."

The wanderer waited. The light was strengthening. Behind them, Deren had stopped coiling rope.

"I came down because I needed to say it to your face." Seren's eyes came back to theirs. "You touched my margins. The ink changed. Something in you — something about you — made the writing *respond*. And now you're leaving, and I don't know what that means. I don't know if you'll come back. I don't know if the writing will keep speaking without you here."

"The Mender's threads are speaking too. It's not me."

"Maybe." Seren's jaw tightened. "Or maybe you woke it. Maybe you came down this river carrying something, and it recognized you, and now you're going back to wherever it came from."

The words hung in the air. The wanderer felt them land somewhere they couldn't name — a weight added to the weights they already carried.

"I don't know what I'm carrying." They said it quietly. "I don't know why my hands reach for things before I decide. I don't know why I felt your margins were alive before you told me. I only know that I have to go."

"Have to?"

"Want to. Have to. I can't tell the difference anymore."

Seren stared at them. The fear was still there — it had never left — but something else was moving underneath it now. Something that might have been envy.

"You can walk toward the thing that frightens you." He said it like a confession. "I've spent my whole life climbing away from the water. Making my records in a room carved into stone. And you — you arrive on a flood, and within a month you're going back upstream to find what made it."

"You could come with us."

The wanderer didn't know they were going to say it until the words were out. Seren's face went through something too fast to read — hope, terror, refusal, grief.

"No." He shook his head, once. "The river takes things and doesn't give them back. I won't add myself to what it carries."

"Then what do you want me to bring you?"

Seren was quiet for a long moment. The sky had turned gold now, catching the silt in the water, turning the quay into something the wanderer would remember.

"An answer." Seren's voice was steadier now. "Any answer. What opened up there. What it's sending down. What the writing in my margins is trying to tell me." He looked at the wanderer directly. "And if you find out what you are — what you're carrying — send word. I'll write it down. That's what I do. I write things down so they don't disappear."

The wanderer reached out and gripped Seren's arm. He flinched, then didn't pull away.

"I'll come back."

"You don't know that."

"No. But I'm saying it anyway."

Something passed between them — not understanding, not forgiveness, but something older. A debt acknowledged. A witness to departure.

Deren's voice carried across the quay: "Current's turning."

The wanderer let go. Seren stepped back, already retreating, already climbing back toward his room of stone and paper. But he stopped at the edge of the path and turned.

"The margins said something this morning. Before dawn. I almost didn't read it — I've been afraid to look." His voice was distant now, speaking from wherever he went when he talked about his ledgers. "It said: *the one who holds between will find the door*."

The wanderer stood very still.

"I don't know what it means," Seren said. "I never know what it means. But it was there this morning, and now you're leaving, and I thought you should hear it."

He turned and walked up the path, and he didn't look back again.

Deren cast off the line as the wanderer stepped into the boat.

"Complicated goodbye?"

"I owed him words."

"Did you pay?"

The wanderer settled onto the bench across from Deren, finding their balance as the current caught the hull. The quay was already sliding back, the town waking behind it, smoke beginning to rise from morning fires.

"I don't know. Maybe he paid me."

Deren didn't ask what that meant. She took up the oars and let the river do most of the work, guiding them toward the channel where the current ran fastest. The water was brown with silt — the same water that had carried the wanderer here a month ago. Now it would carry them back.

The pouch shifted against the wanderer's hip. Still warm. Still waiting.

The Mender's building grew small, then vanished behind a bend. The stone quay where the wanderer had watched lamp-light on water. The Meeting Point where they'd first stood with wet feet, wondering what kind of place they'd arrived.

Gone.

Ahead, the river ran straight for a while, then curved into green distance. The interior. The coordinates. Whatever had opened.

"Eight days," Deren said. "If the current's kind."

The wanderer looked at their hands. They were gripping the boat's edge, knuckles white, as if the wood might escape.

*The one who holds between will find the door.*

They didn't know what it meant either. But something in them was listening, the way you listen when you know a voice is about to speak — not yet heard, but already shaping the silence.

## The Wanderer

The wanderer took the oar when Deren offered it.

Not because they knew what to do — because their hands were too still. The motion helped. Pull, lift, return. The river resisted, then gave. The boat moved forward.

Seren's words were somewhere behind them, floating in the water or sinking into stone. The wanderer couldn't tell which. Their arms burned after an hour, but they kept rowing.

Deren watched from the other bench, saying nothing.

## World Tokens

**Seren at the Water's Edge**
The man who never comes to the river, standing on the quay at dawn. Grey robes wrong in waterfront light. Hands empty where a ledger should be. The fear still there, but something like envy moving underneath.

**The Message in the Margins**
*The one who holds between will find the door.* Words that appeared before dawn in handwriting that isn't Seren's. He didn't ask for it. He was afraid to read it. Now it travels upriver with the one who might understand.

**The River Channel**
Where the current runs fastest, brown with silt from the interior. The town disappears behind the first bend. Ahead: green distance, the unknown, eight days if the river is kind.

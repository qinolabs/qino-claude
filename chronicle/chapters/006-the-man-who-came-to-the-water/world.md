# The World

*Last updated: Chapter 7*

## Pressures

*What's building. What's calling.*

### The Pouch Approaching Soon
Warmer than body heat now. Something shifts inside, between states. The wanderer reached for it without deciding, then pulled back. *Not yet* — but the distinction between "not yet" and "soon" is narrowing. Some things announce their own timing.

### The Message Unread
*The one who holds between will find the door.* The wanderer said it aloud to Deren, and Deren asked: between what and what? No answer. The message travels upstream, waiting for the right silence to unfold it.

### Seven Days Ahead
One day of river behind them. Seven more to the last known village. Three past that to the coordinates. The current turned against them; it won't get easier. What lives along the banks between here and there? What villages, what people who have never seen the harbor?

### The Mirror Waking Without Witness
The threads move. The margins fill. Two keepers in the middle of something they've waited decades to understand. And the one who might have helped them see it has gone upriver. The understanding will happen without the wanderer — or wait until they return. The Mirror doesn't care about departure.

### The Wanderer's Habit
You row like someone who's afraid to stop. Deren said it without accusation, and the wanderer couldn't deny it. Motion as escape — the pattern is visible now. What else is the wanderer running from while running toward?

## The World's Breath

First night on the river. The sandbar warm from afternoon sun, now cooling under stars. Fire making sounds beside water making sounds. The boat pulled up on silt, waiting for dawn. The wanderer's hands bandaged, resting. Deren's presence — practical, not unkind. The green distance upstream, invisible in darkness, but present. Something to be rowed toward when the light returns.

## The Wanderer

*Updated after Chapter 7*

Forced to stop before they were ready. Deren took the oars, made them rest, tended their bleeding hands. In the stillness, things surfaced: the weight of leaving, the warmth of the pouch, the questions that motion was keeping at bay.

**What pulls at them:**
- The message: *the one who holds between will find the door* — said aloud now, shared, still unknown
- The pouch warming toward *soon* — reached for without deciding, pulled back from
- Deren's observation: "someone who doesn't know what they're carrying but carries it anyway"
- The pattern of running — now visible, harder to hide behind

**Carries now:**
- Coordinates from Seren, pointing three days past the last known village
- The leather pouch from the Mender, warming, shifting, approaching its moment
- Bandaged hands and the knowledge that exhaustion isn't effort
- Deren's words: "You don't plan your way through. You feel your way."

**Last seen:** Gathering firewood at dusk. Eating dried fish by firelight. Listening to the river's sounds, learning them.

*What remains unspoken:*
Deren sees something. "Someone who doesn't know what they're carrying. But carries it anyway." The wanderer's hands remembered rowing before their mind decided to row. The pouch shifted and they reached for it without choosing. Between what and what? The wanderer doesn't know. But something in them is answering before they understand the question.

## Characters

### The Mender
First appeared: Chapter 1, working in the shallows at the Meeting Point

Works where river meets sea, and in her building full of threads. The threads are answering now — twenty years of questions finding response. She gave the wanderer something to carry: a pouch she'd held for a year without opening.

The wanderer left without seeing her again. She would have been watching.

### Seren
First appeared: Chapter 3, at his desk beneath a window looking out over the harbor

Record-keeper in a building carved half into the hill. Frightened by the writing in his margins — but something else moves underneath the fear now. He came to the water at dawn, the first time anyone remembers. He asked for an answer, any answer. He said: *if you find out what you are, send word. I'll write it down.*

He walked back up the hillside and didn't look back.

### Deren
First appeared: Chapter 5, loading a boat at the river quay

River carrier. Fifteen years on the passage between coast and interior. Hands rough with calluses that have patterns, but gentle when working salve into raw places. She sees things about people — not invasively, just clearly. What she notices, she names.

She stopped the wanderer from rowing themselves raw. "The river doesn't care how hard you work. It goes where it goes. You can't outrun it."

She knows when to speak and when silence is better. She threw a stone that skipped three times before sinking.

## Locations

### The Meeting Point
Stone quay where the river surrenders to the sea. Water changes color here — brown to grey-green. The Mender works here when the tide is right. Behind them now.

### The Mender's Building
Small structure set back from the waterfront. Papers on every surface. Threads spanning walls — red, blue, and green. The green ones move on their own. Somewhere behind, getting smaller.

### Seren's Building
Where the hillside steps end, half-carved into the hill. Shelves floor to ceiling, ledgers in leather and cloth and stranger materials. The margins fill with writing that isn't his. The wanderer left without climbing those steps again.

### The River Quay
Upstream from the stone quay, where the water is still brown with silt. Shallow-draft boats built for distance. Where Seren came at dawn, grey robes wrong in waterfront light. Where the journey began.

### The River Channel
Where the current runs fastest. The town disappeared behind the first bend. Green distance ahead, banks closer now, trees leaning over from both sides.

### The Sandbar
A low curve where the river bends, silt and stone gathered by slower water. Warm in afternoon sun, cooling at night. The kind of place boats stop when the current turns against them. First camp. Fire circle cleared in the sand. The boat pulled up on silt, hull scraped, waiting.

### Unexplored

**The Interior**
Where the river comes from. Where the flood originated. Where the coordinates point. Seven days to the last known village. Three more past that to whatever opened. The river narrows there, becomes something else. Ahead now, closer than yesterday.

**The River Villages**
Settlements along the passage. Places Deren knows — traders, families, people who watch the river for what it carries. The wanderer hasn't seen them yet. Seven days of villages before the last known one.

**The Hills Behind Town**
Ruins older than memory. Stone circles, empty towers, carvings in languages scholars argue over. Whatever lived here before is gone, or quiet, or waiting. Behind now. But ruins aren't only in the harbor.

**The Harbor Proper**
Where the larger ships dock. Creatures from the depths, beings who drifted in on currents only they can feel. The wanderer never saw it fully. Maybe they will when they return.

## Arcs in Motion

### The Journey Upstream
*Shape:* something calling outward
*Scale:* has weight (underway)
*Holds:* What opened in the interior? What will the wanderer find at the coordinates? What is the pouch, and why was it waiting for them?
*Moves toward:* Arrival at the coordinates — and whatever waits there. Seven days of river first. The journey reveals as much as the destination.

One day traveled. First stop at the sandbar. The wanderer learned they can't outrow the current. Deren knows the way; the wanderer is learning to trust that.

### The Wanderer's Hands
*Shape:* hidden
*Scale:* has weight
*Holds:* What does the wanderer's body remember that their mind has forgotten? What are they holding that others recognize?
*Moves toward:* Memory surfacing — perhaps on the journey, perhaps at the destination. Their hands already know the way.

The hands reached for the pouch without deciding. They rowed past sense until Deren stopped them. They know something about holding between — but between what and what? Deren sees: "someone who doesn't know what they're carrying. But carries it anyway."

### The Mirror Waking
*Shape:* something hidden becoming visible
*Scale:* long
*Holds:* What is the pattern that writes in margins and moves threads? What does it mean that understanding can emerge from keeping?
*Moves toward:* The wanderer has left this arc behind — for now. The Mirror will continue waking without them. Or it will wait.

The keepers are in the middle of something. The wanderer chose to go before understanding arrives. This arc continues in the harbor while the journey arc unfolds upriver. Seren's message suggests the Mirror knows something about the wanderer: *the one who holds between*.

## The Season

Summer still, but the light is different on the river. First day done. Night on the sandbar, fire small, river sounds in the dark. The wanderer's hands wrapped in cloth. Their body remembering that stillness has its own rhythm. Dawn will come, and with it, the current to be rowed against again. Seven days to the last village. Three more past that. The journey measured in what the river allows.

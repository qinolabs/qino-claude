# Chapter 002 Prep

## Grounding
**Sensory palette:** salt, timber, rope, canal-water, lamp oil, wet stone, reed, tar
**Pressures:** The Stranger from Upriver — what did they see? Why did they come alone?
**The world's strangeness:** The channels have names, not numbers. Locals navigate by which families live where, which boats are moored at which posts. A newcomer would notice there are no maps — only memory, passed hand to hand.
**Scene seed:** Kael + Daven at the merchant's counting table — the child came asking questions about upriver; Daven is deciding whether to answer honestly or protect the child from knowing

## World Behavior
**Shape:** Appearance + Transformation — new things emerging while existing things clarify; maturing, organizing
**The world does:** A ship has arrived at the harbor — storytellers aboard, tales of far adventures. The delta flocks to listen. The quiet upriver question — shapeless, subtle, close — could dissolve into background against this easier attention.
**Points toward:** Those who hold quiet questions; those who choose where to place attention; the contrast between exciting far-away stories and the shapeless unknown close at hand

## Story Lens

**Lens:** The Discovery

**Foreground these sensitivities:**
- World as Participant — the place reveals what it was holding (through Daven's evasion)
- Embodied Presence — the cost of knowing felt in the body
- Indirect Action — the gap between what's meant and said

**Territory:** The protection becomes the telling — in trying to explain why he won't answer, Daven accidentally reveals there IS something to know

**Craft note:** Discovery changes the discoverer. What shifts because of what Kael now knows? (Or suspects?)

## Beat
**Opening situation:** Daven's counting room, morning — the sound of the harbor crowd distant through the window. Kael appears in the doorway while Daven is mid-calculation.

**Who's involved:**
- Kael: wants to understand what upriver means, why adults go quiet about it / protecting their right to know what others seem to be hiding
- Daven: wants to shield Kael from adult fears, maintain the child's world / protecting his own uncertainty — he doesn't actually know what upriver holds, only that people fear it

**What's unsaid:** Daven's protection reveals his own fear. The harder he tries not to answer, the more Kael understands there's something worth fearing. The silence itself becomes information.

**Stakes:**
- What could be lost: Kael's uncomplicated relationship to the delta; their trust in adults who seem to be hiding something
- What could be gained: A child who begins to read the silences, who understands that some questions don't have storytellers

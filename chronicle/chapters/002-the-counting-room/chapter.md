# The Counting Room

_Morning, with the harbor alive_

---

The sound of the crowd came through the window like water finding its level — rising, falling, never quite settling. Daven kept his head down over the ledger, moving dried beans from one pile to another. Salt bushels. Lamp oil by the barrel. The steady work of knowing what the delta had and what it needed.

Kael appeared in the doorway without knocking. The child had that look — the one that meant a question was coming, and not the kind that had easy answers.

"The storytellers," Kael said. "From the ship."

"I heard." Daven didn't look up. He moved another bean. "Half the harbor's down there listening."

"You're not."

"Someone has to know how much rope we have." He gestured at the ledger, the careful columns. "The world doesn't stop needing things because a ship arrives."

Kael stepped into the room. The timber floor creaked in the place it always creaked — third board from the door, the one Daven kept meaning to fix. The child moved to the window, looking out toward the distant sound of voices, of laughter, of stories being told.

"They're talking about the far islands," Kael said. "Sea caves full of crystals. A fish that glows like a lamp."

"Sounds like good stories."

"Mirin says they're lies."

Daven allowed himself a small smile. "Mirin would."

The crowd-sound swelled, then faded. Someone was reaching the good part of something. Kael stayed at the window, but their attention had shifted — Daven could feel it, the way you feel weather changing.

"I asked one of them," Kael said. "About upriver."

Daven's hand stopped over the beans. He made himself move it again, made himself count. Seventeen. Eighteen.

"What did they say?"

"Nothing." Kael turned from the window. "They said they didn't know anything about upriver. But they smiled when they said it. The way you smile when you're being polite about something."

"Maybe they don't know anything about upriver. They sail the coast. The open water."

"Then why smile like that?"

Daven set down the bean he was holding. He looked at the child — really looked. Kael had their mother's eyes, that particular shade of grey-green that matched the delta water on overcast days. And that same way of standing when they wanted something, weight slightly forward, as if they might lean into the answer.

"People smile for all kinds of reasons."

"You're doing it now."

He wasn't, but he felt his face wanting to. He made himself stay still, stay neutral.

"Kael. The storytellers have traveled far and seen strange things. Things worth listening to. Why aren't you down there with the others?"

"Because I don't care about far." Kael moved closer to the counting table, put their hands on its edge. The wood was worn smooth there, from years of people leaning exactly this way. "I care about here. About what's close. And everyone acts like upriver is nothing, just forest and swamp, but then they go quiet about it. Like you're doing now."

"I'm not going quiet."

"You stopped counting."

Daven looked at the beans. He had stopped counting. He made himself pick one up, put it in the proper pile. He'd lost track of which pile was which.

"There's nothing upriver that concerns you."

"But there's something."

The word hung in the air between them. Something. Not nothing, which was what Daven had meant to say. What he'd meant to imply. He'd offered the child a thread and now watched them pull it.

"Forests," he said, too quickly. "Swampland. The channels get narrow, hard to navigate. Pilots lose their way."

"And?"

"And nothing. That's what's upriver. Difficulty. Risk. That's why we don't go."

Kael was watching him the way the herons watched the shallows — patient, still, waiting for movement. Daven felt himself becoming the fish.

"Mirin's father went upriver once," Kael said. "Years ago. He doesn't talk about it."

"Some trips aren't worth talking about."

"He came back different. Mirin says he used to sing. On the boat, while he was working. Now he doesn't."

Daven pushed his chair back from the table. The scrape of wood on wood was too loud in the small room. He went to the window, stood where Kael had stood. The harbor crowd was visible from here, a mass of people gathered around the visiting ship. He could see the storytellers on the deck, gesturing broadly, their voices carrying as a distant music without words.

"That's where the stories are," he said. "Out there. The far islands, the crystal caves, the glowing fish. That's what people want to hear about."

"I don't."

"I know." He turned back to face the child. "I know you don't. That's what worries me."

Kael's expression shifted — something opening in it, something that might have been hope. "So there is something. Something you're not telling me."

"I'm telling you that some questions don't have storytellers. Some questions have silence, and maybe that silence is the only answer there is. Maybe the reason no one talks about upriver is because there's nothing to say. Or maybe—" He stopped himself.

"Maybe what?"

The canal-water smell came through the window, mixed with the salt of the harbor, the distant tar from the shipyard. This was his world, Daven thought. This counting room, these ledgers, this work of knowing what the delta had and needed. He'd spent his life here, staying close to what was known.

"Maybe we don't talk about it because we don't know what to say. Because knowing something and understanding it are different things."

Kael stood very still. The crowd-sound swelled again — cheering now, or laughter, the response to some climax in a tale.

"So you're not protecting me," Kael said slowly. "You're—"

"I don't know what I'm doing." The words came out before he could stop them. He heard them as if someone else had spoken. "I don't know what's upriver, Kael. Not really. Stories, yes. Hunters who came back strange. Caravans that didn't come back at all. But I've never seen it. I've never gone."

"Why not?"

The question was simple. A child's question. Daven looked at his ledger, his beans, his careful columns. Salt bushels. Lamp oil. The steady work of staying in place.

"Because I'm afraid," he said. "And I don't even know of what."

The silence that followed was different from the silences before. Kael looking at him, not as a child looks at an adult who has answers, but as something else. Someone seeing clearly for the first time.

"Thank you," Kael said quietly.

Then they turned and left, the third board creaking under their step, the sound of the harbor rising to fill the space they'd emptied.

Daven stood at the window for a long time after. The storytellers were still talking, their gestures broad against the morning light. The delta flocked to listen. The glowing fish, the crystal caves, the wonders of far-away.

He went back to his counting. He'd lost track, so he began again.

## The Wanderer

From the Anchor's side door, the wanderer watched the harbor crowd thin as the morning wore on. The storytellers had finished their first telling; there would be another at midday.

They walked to the water's edge, where the canal met a stone quay worn smooth by decades of rope and boot. A coil of rope lay abandoned on the stones — someone's carelessness, or intention to return. The wanderer picked it up, felt its weight, its salt-roughness. Then they coiled it properly, the way they'd been shown on the journey here, and hung it on the post where it belonged.

A woman mending nets nearby nodded once, unsurprised.

The wanderer nodded back and kept walking.

## World Tokens

**The Third Board**
In Daven's counting room, the floorboard that announces visitors. He's meant to fix it for years. He never has. Some warnings become familiar enough to keep.

**The Coiled Rope**
Harbor etiquette: you don't leave rope on the ground. Someone could trip, or it could roll into the water, or it could simply say something about you that you didn't mean to say. Newcomers learn this quickly, or they're noticed.

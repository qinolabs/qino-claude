## Prep Layer

### Checkpoint 1: Scene Seeds
**Chosen:** Kael + Daven at the merchant's counting table — the child came asking questions about upriver; Daven is deciding whether to answer honestly or protect the child from knowing

### Checkpoint 2: World Behavior
**User direction:** A ship arrives at the harbor with storytellers telling tales of far adventures. People flock to hear them. Creative tension: quiet, close stories could dissolve into background when faced with exciting far-away tales. Not that far stories are bad — but the human tendency to shift attention away from the unknown and shapeless when offered an easier alternative.

### Checkpoint 3: Directions
**Chosen:** Combined — opening from The Gathering (Daven's counting room, harbor crowd distant through window, Kael appears in doorway) with story from The Discovery (protection becomes the telling — Daven accidentally reveals there IS something to know)

## Editorial Review

**Pass 1:** APPROVED

The editorial agent noted:
- The beans as metaphor for Daven's coping — losing count mirrors losing composure, without stating it
- "You stopped counting" sharper than any explanatory paragraph
- The third board earns its place twice without becoming self-conscious
- Daven's admission lands because the scene built pressure without announcing it
- Wanderer section practices restraint — rope coiling as gesture without interpretation

## Post-Prose

- Added pressure: A Child Reading Silences (Kael has begun to notice what adults won't say)
- Updated World's Breath: the storytellers' ship, far stories vs. close questions
- Updated Wanderer: last seen walking the stone quay, coiling rope; strangeness observed by net-mending woman
- Updated Kael: voice sharpened, now watching silences
- Updated Daven: admitted fear to a child, saw through his own protection
- Added Mirin: mentioned by Kael, father who went upriver and came back changed
- Added locations: Daven's Counting Room, The Stone Quay

**Arc updates:**
- The Upriver Question: advanced (Kael now seeking answers)
- A Child Reading Silences: begun (Kael learned protection and fear wear the same face)

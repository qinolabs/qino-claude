## The Upriver Question

*Shape:* hidden
*Chapters:* 1-

**In motion:**
*Holds:* What did the wanderer see upriver? Why did they come alone from a direction no stranger travels?
*Moves toward:* The silence may break — through the wanderer's own telling, through what others piece together, or through what the upriver sends next. Now Kael is seeking answers too — a child who prefers close questions to far stories.

*Chapters:* 1-

**In motion:**

## A Child Reading Silences

*Shape:* building
*Chapters:* 2-

**In motion:**
*Holds:* Kael has learned that adults fear what they don't understand. Daven admitted he's afraid of upriver — and doesn't know why. The protection became the telling.
*Moves toward:* What Kael does with this knowledge. Whether they seek the wanderer next. Whether they tell Mirin, whose father came back changed.

# The World

*Last updated: Chapter 8*

## Pressures

*What's building. What's calling.*

### The Pouch's History
It passed through here before. Years ago, going the other way — from the interior toward the sea. Lira felt it then and didn't understand. Now it's going home. What waits for it there? What happens when something returns to where it came from?

### Word Traveling Faster Than Water
The river villages know about the wanderer. "The one from the harbor. The one who came down on the flood." News moves upstream ahead of them. Who else is waiting? Who else has heard?

### The Message Still Unread
*The one who holds between will find the door.* Lira recognized the words — not their meaning, but their weight. Something old surfaced in her face. Between what and what? The wanderer is carrying a question they don't know how to ask.

### Five Days Ahead
Two days traveled. Orith's Landing behind them now. The third bend by nightfall, if the current helps. The villages ahead will have heard too. The wanderer is becoming known before they arrive.

### The Mirror Waking Without Witness
The threads move. The margins fill. The keepers in the middle of something they've waited decades to understand. Lira said something is changing faster than she thought — even Seren came to the water. The understanding will happen without the wanderer, or wait until they return.

## The World's Breath

Second night on the river, but not alone this time. A village built on platforms, the current moving underneath, smoke rising into evening air. The wanderer ate strange bread and was watched by strangers who already knew their story. Lira's hands stained dark, tracing patterns on a table. Deren laughing with people she knows. The interior getting closer — five days now, maybe less.

## The Wanderer

*Updated after Chapter 8*

Known before they arrive. Lira felt them pass on the flood. Maret knew who they were before anyone spoke. The pouch has a history the wanderer doesn't know — it passed through Orith's Landing years ago, going the other way. Now they're taking it home.

**What pulls at them:**
- The message: *the one who holds between will find the door* — Lira recognized the words but not the meaning
- The pouch warming toward *soon* — Lira saw it without being shown, called it "something that's waking"
- What Lira said: "The interior holds things the coast has forgotten"
- Being known by strangers, watched by villages that heard of them before they arrived

**Carries now:**
- Coordinates from Seren, pointing three days past the last known village
- The leather pouch from the Mender, warming, carrying something that's been here before
- Bandaged hands healing
- Lira's words: "You're taking it home"

**Last seen:** Sitting at the village's edge, feet over the water, eating dark bread, watching the current move.

*What remains unspoken:*
The villages feel them. Lira felt them pass on the flood — "most who carry that much don't pause." Maret looked at their hands, their feet, the way they stood. Something in the wanderer is visible to those who know how to look. They are being read by a river that has been watching longer than they've been traveling.

## Characters

### The Mender
First appeared: Chapter 1, working in the shallows at the Meeting Point

Works where river meets sea, and in her building full of threads. The threads are answering now — twenty years of questions finding response. She gave the wanderer something to carry: a pouch she'd held for a year without opening.

The wanderer left without seeing her again. She would have been watching.

### Seren
First appeared: Chapter 3, at his desk beneath a window looking out over the harbor

Record-keeper in a building carved half into the hill. Frightened by the writing in his margins — but something else moves underneath the fear now. He came to the water at dawn, the first time anyone remembers. He asked for an answer, any answer. He said: *if you find out what you are, send word. I'll write it down.*

Lira knows of him: "Never leaves his stone room. Some people are afraid to know what they might feel."

### Deren
First appeared: Chapter 5, loading a boat at the river quay

River carrier. Fifteen years on the passage between coast and interior. Hands rough with calluses that have patterns, but gentle when working salve into raw places. She sees things about people — not invasively, just clearly.

At Orith's Landing, she was different. Looser. Laughing with people she knew. Someone returning to a shape they'd almost forgotten. The villages are her world too.

### Lira
First appeared: Chapter 8, stepping out of the elder's house at Orith's Landing

Elder of Orith's Landing. Braid past her waist, eyes sharp with decades of river light, hands stained dark with something — ink, maybe, or something older. She felt the wanderer pass on the flood. She recognized what the pouch carries — it passed through here years ago, going the other way. "Now you're taking it home."

She recognized the words from the margins too. Something old surfaced in her face.

### Maret
First appeared: Chapter 8, helping them onto the platform at Orith's Landing

Grey-haired woman of Orith's Landing. Watches more than she speaks. Knew the wanderer was "the one from the harbor" before anyone said it. Sat near the door during the meal, never looking away for long.

## Locations

### The Meeting Point
Stone quay where the river surrenders to the sea. Water changes color here — brown to grey-green. The Mender works here when the tide is right. Behind them now.

### The Mender's Building
Small structure set back from the waterfront. Papers on every surface. Threads spanning walls — red, blue, and green. The green ones move on their own. Somewhere behind, getting smaller.

### Seren's Building
Where the hillside steps end, half-carved into the hill. Shelves floor to ceiling, ledgers in leather and cloth and stranger materials. The margins fill with writing that isn't his. The wanderer left without climbing those steps again.

### The River Quay
Upstream from the stone quay, where the water is still brown with silt. Shallow-draft boats built for distance. Where Seren came at dawn, grey robes wrong in waterfront light. Where the journey began.

### The River Channel
Where the current runs fastest. The town disappeared behind the first bend. Green distance ahead, banks closer now, trees leaning over from both sides.

### The Sandbar
A low curve where the river bends, silt and stone gathered by slower water. Warm in afternoon sun, cooling at night. First camp. Fire circle cleared in the sand.

### Orith's Landing
A village built on platforms and bridges, swaying with the current. Rope strung between structures, smoke rising, children who watch approaching boats with the stillness of practice. First stop on the passage to the interior. Word travels faster than water here — they knew the wanderer before the boat arrived.

### Unexplored

**The Interior**
Where the river comes from. Where the flood originated. Where the coordinates point. Five days to the last known village now. Three past that to whatever opened. The river narrows there, becomes something else. Getting closer.

**The River Villages**
More settlements along the passage. Places Deren knows — traders, families, people who watch the river for what it carries. Orith's Landing was the first. More ahead — and they've heard.

**The Hills Behind Town**
Ruins older than memory. Stone circles, empty towers, carvings in languages scholars argue over. Whatever lived here before is gone, or quiet, or waiting. Behind now. But ruins aren't only in the harbor.

**The Harbor Proper**
Where the larger ships dock. Creatures from the depths, beings who drifted in on currents only they can feel. The wanderer never saw it fully. Maybe they will when they return.

## The Season

Summer still, but the light changes on the river. Second day done, first village behind. The wanderer ate dark bread and was watched by people who'd heard of them before they arrived. The pouch has a history — it passed through Orith's Landing years ago, going the other way. Now it's going home. Five days to the last village. Three more past that. The journey measured in bends and villages and what the river remembers.

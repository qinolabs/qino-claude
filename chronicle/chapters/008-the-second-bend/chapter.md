# The Second Bend

*The second day, afternoon*

---

The village appeared around a bend the wanderer hadn't expected.

One moment: green banks, the river narrowing between overhanging trees. The next: wooden platforms jutting into the water, rope bridges strung between them, smoke rising from somewhere the wanderer couldn't see. A child stood on the nearest platform, watching them approach with the stillness of someone who'd been waiting.

Deren raised a hand. The child didn't wave back — just turned and ran, bare feet slapping the wet planks.

"Orith's Landing," Deren said. She was already guiding the boat toward the platforms, reading currents the wanderer couldn't see. "We'll stop here."

"We have light left."

"We'll stop here." Deren's voice had shifted — softer, or maybe just different. The wanderer realized they'd never heard her speak to anyone but them. "They'll want to know what's coming downriver. And I—" She paused. "There's someone I should see."

The boat scraped against the platform's edge. Hands reached down — a woman with grey in her hair, a man younger than the wanderer, both of them helping without speaking. The wanderer climbed out and stood on wood that swayed with the current underneath.

The woman looked at them. Not at their face — at their hands, their feet, the way they stood. Then at Deren, who was tying off the boat with the same loops and tucks the wanderer had watched for two days.

"You brought someone."

"Passage to the interior." Deren finished the knot. "They're paying. I'm taking them."

"That far?"

"That far."

The woman's eyes came back to the wanderer. Something in her gaze made the wanderer want to explain themselves — but there was nothing to say that would fit in this moment, in this place. They waited.

"The one from the harbor." The woman said it like a fact, not a question. "The one who came down on the flood."

The wanderer's throat tightened. "You've heard."

"Word travels faster than water." The woman turned toward the village, already walking. "Come. Lira will want to see you."

---

The village was built on platforms and bridges, everything connected by rope and plank. The wanderer followed the grey-haired woman through a maze of structures — some permanent, some canvas stretched over frames — while Deren walked beside the younger man, their voices low, catching up on something the wanderer wasn't part of.

People watched. Not staring — glancing, then looking away. A woman gutting fish on a low table. An old man mending a net that looked older than him. Children following at a distance, whispering.

The wanderer felt the weight of being seen. In the harbor, they'd been one arrival among many. Here, they were the only stranger.

The grey-haired woman stopped at a larger structure — more permanent than the others, with a door instead of canvas. Smoke rose from a hole in the roof. Inside, the wanderer could hear voices.

"Wait here."

She went in. The wanderer stood on the platform, feeling it shift beneath their feet. Deren was still somewhere behind, still talking. The pouch was warm against the wanderer's hip — warmer than yesterday, warmer than this morning. They didn't reach for it.

The door opened.

A woman stepped out. Older than the grey-haired one, but straighter, her eyes sharp in a face that had weathered decades of river light. She wore her hair in a single braid that fell past her waist, and her hands — the wanderer noticed her hands first — were stained with something dark. Ink, maybe. Or something else.

"The one who came down." Lira's voice was like the river itself — low, moving, carrying things beneath the surface. "We felt you pass."

"Felt?"

"The water talks to those who listen." Lira stepped closer, close enough that the wanderer could smell herbs and smoke and something metallic. "You came down carrying weight. I wondered if you'd stop. Most who carry that much don't pause for villages."

The wanderer didn't know what to say. They hadn't paused — they'd been carried by current and storm, barely conscious, holding onto what mattered while everything else was lost.

"I didn't choose to stop."

"No." Lira almost smiled. "The river chose for you. And now you're going back." Her eyes moved to the wanderer's hip — to where the pouch hung hidden under cloth. "With something that's waking."

The wanderer went still.

"I won't ask to see it." Lira's voice was gentle. "Some things aren't for showing. But I'll tell you this: what you're carrying was carried before. It passed through here once, years ago, going the other way. I was younger then. I didn't understand what I felt." Her stained hand touched her own chest, briefly. "Now you're taking it home."

"Home?"

"Wherever it came from. The interior holds things the coast has forgotten." Lira turned back toward the door. "You'll eat with us. Rest. The current reverses at dusk — you'll have help tomorrow morning."

She went inside. The wanderer stood alone on the platform, the village moving around them, the river running underneath.

They ate in the common space — smoked fish, river greens, bread that was darker and denser than what the wanderer knew from the harbor. Deren sat across from them, talking with people she clearly knew, laughing at something the wanderer didn't catch. She looked different here. Looser. Like someone returning to a shape they'd almost forgotten.

The wanderer ate and listened. The conversation moved around them — harvest predictions, a boat that had passed through last week carrying strange cargo, a child who'd been sick and was now better. Ordinary life. The rhythm of people who lived between places, watching what the river carried.

No one asked the wanderer questions. But they were watched — glances over cups, eyes that lingered when they thought the wanderer wasn't looking. The grey-haired woman — Maret, someone had called her — sat near the door and never looked away for long.

After the meal, Lira came to sit beside them.

"Deren tells me you don't know what's at the coordinates."

"No."

"Neither do we. But the water's been different since spring. Heavier. Carrying more." Lira's stained fingers traced patterns on the table — patterns the wanderer almost recognized, like letters in a language they'd forgotten. "Things pass through here that don't stop. They're going somewhere. Or coming from somewhere. The direction matters less than the movement."

"The Mender's threads are moving too." The wanderer heard themselves say it. "In the harbor. And the record-keeper's margins—"

"The one who writes?" Lira's eyes sharpened. "Seren. Yes. We've heard of him. Never leaves his stone room." Her voice held something that might have been sympathy. "Some people are afraid to know what they might feel. Easier to record than to experience."

The wanderer thought of Seren at the quay, grey robes wrong in waterfront light. The way he'd flinched when they touched his arm.

"He came to the water. The morning I left."

Lira was quiet for a moment. Then: "Then something is changing faster than I thought."

She stood, brushing crumbs from her lap. The wanderer looked up at her — at the braid, the stained hands, the eyes that had seen decades of arrivals and departures.

"The one who holds between." The wanderer said it without deciding to. The words from Seren's margins. "Do you know what that means?"

Lira's face changed. Not surprise — recognition. Something old surfacing.

"Between what and what?"

"I don't know."

"Neither do I." She looked at the wanderer differently now — not as stranger, not as guest. As something else. "But I think you'll find out. That's why you're going."

She walked away, disappearing into the smoke and conversation. The wanderer sat with the words, with the weight of being known by strangers, with the pouch warm against their hip.

Deren appeared and dropped onto the bench beside them.

"Lira likes you."

"How can you tell?"

"She talked to you." Deren reached for the last piece of bread. "She doesn't talk to everyone. Some people pass through and she just watches." She tore the bread, handed half to the wanderer. "You should sleep. The current turns early, and I want to make the third bend by nightfall."

The wanderer took the bread. Their hands were steadier than they expected.

## The Wanderer

The wanderer found a platform at the village's edge, where the river sounds were louder than the voices.

They sat with their feet hanging over the water, watching the current move. Somewhere behind them, the village was settling into evening. Somewhere ahead, the interior waited — six days now, maybe five if the current was kind.

The bread was still in their hand. They ate it slowly, tasting the strange grain, the river water that had gone into its making.

Lira had recognized something. The pouch. The words from the margins. The weight the wanderer carried without understanding.

*It passed through here once, years ago, going the other way.*

They looked at the water. It moved the same direction it always had — downriver, toward the sea. But underneath, in currents the wanderer couldn't see, something else was traveling.

A fish jumped, silver in the failing light. The wanderer watched the ripples spread and disappear.

## World Tokens

**Orith's Landing**
A village built on platforms and bridges, swaying with the current. Smoke rising, rope strung between structures, children who watch approaching boats with the stillness of practice. First stop on the passage to the interior.

**Lira**
Elder of Orith's Landing, with a braid that falls past her waist and hands stained dark with something. She felt the wanderer pass on the flood. She recognizes what the pouch holds — or at least, recognizes that it passed through here before, going the other way.

**Maret**
Grey-haired woman who first received them at the platform. Watches more than she speaks. Knew the wanderer was "the one from the harbor" before anyone said it.

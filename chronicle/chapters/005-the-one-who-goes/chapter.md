# The One Who Goes

*Morning, the day after the threads*

---

The wanderer woke to the sound of someone loading a boat.

Not the harbor sounds — those had become familiar, the creak and call of the larger vessels. This was closer. River-side. The scrape of wood on stone, the particular rhythm of someone who knew what they were doing and didn't need to think about it.

The coordinates were still in their pocket. They'd slept with them there, paper against hip, as if the numbers might escape in the night.

The wanderer dressed and went to find the sound.

---

A woman was loading a shallow-draft boat at the river quay — not the stone quay where the wanderer had sat watching lamp-light, but further up, where the water was still brown with silt from the interior. She moved crates and wrapped bundles with the efficiency of long practice, her back to the wanderer, her hands never pausing.

"You're the one from the flood," she said without turning. "The one the Mender's been asking about."

The wanderer stopped at the edge of the quay. The woman's boat was longer than it looked, built for distance. Oars shipped but a small sail furled at the mast.

"She's been asking?"

"Sent word to the river families yesterday. Wanted to know who was going up before the season turns." The woman straightened, finally looking at the wanderer. Her face was weathered in a way the harbor people weren't — sun and wind from open water, not the salt-softened air of the coast. "I'm Deren. I make the passage twice a year. Once up, once down."

"And you're going up now."

"Tomorrow morning. The current's right." Deren's eyes moved to the wanderer's hands — that same attention the keepers had given. "You're the one with the coordinates."

The wanderer's fingers found the paper in their pocket without deciding to. "The Mender gave them to me. She said they're for whoever goes."

"They're for the place that opened. The one that's been sending things down." Deren turned back to her loading, lifting a crate that should have been too heavy for one person. "I've been carrying cargo to the interior for fifteen years. I know every bend, every sandbar, every village that trades with the coast. But I don't know what's at those coordinates. No one does. It wasn't there before spring."

The wanderer watched her work. There was something in the way Deren handled things — not careful exactly, but attentive. Each bundle placed with awareness of what was already there, what would shift when the boat moved.

"How do you remember what you're carrying?"

Deren paused. It was the first time her rhythm had broken.

"I don't write it down, if that's what you're asking." She set down the crate she was holding, slower than the others. "Lists are for people who need to prove they carried something. I know what I'm carrying because I carried it."

"What if you forget?"

"Then it wasn't mine to remember." Deren's hand rested on the crate. "Some things you hold because they need holding. Some things pass through. The difference isn't in the thing — it's in you. What your hands recognize."

The wanderer thought of the Mender's threads, the green ones that moved without being touched. Of Seren's margins, filling with meaning he never asked for. Of their own hands, reaching for papers before the mind decided.

"I want to come with you."

The words were out before they'd finished forming. Deren looked at them — not surprised, but measuring. The way the Mender had measured, that first day at the Meeting Point.

"The passage takes eight days if the current's kind. Longer if it isn't." Deren picked up the crate again. "You'd be leaving before you understand what's happening here. The keepers — they're in the middle of something. The threads, the writing. You're part of it."

"I know."

"And you want to go anyway."

The wanderer's hand was still in their pocket, touching the coordinates. The paper felt different than it had last night — warmer, or maybe that was just their skin.

"The Mender said the numbers aren't for her. They're for whoever goes." They pulled the paper out, unfolded it. Seren's careful handwriting, the coordinates that pointed toward the interior. "She's been waiting twenty years for answers. She can wait longer. But whatever opened up there — it's been sending things down for months. Someone should go see what it is."

Deren set down the crate. She crossed the deck to where the wanderer stood at the quay's edge, and she looked at the coordinates in their hand.

"Those numbers are three days past the last village I know. The river narrows there. Becomes something else." Her voice had changed — quieter, more careful. "I've never gone that far. Never had reason to."

"But you could."

"I could try." Deren's eyes moved from the paper to the wanderer's face. "Why do you want to go? Not the reason you'd tell the keepers. The real one."

The wanderer didn't answer immediately. The morning light was strengthening, catching the silt in the water, turning it gold. Somewhere behind them, the harbor was waking — voices, the smell of bread and fish, the ordinary sounds of a town that had learned to wait.

"Something in me already knows what's there," they said finally. "I can feel it. The way my hands feel things before I decide to feel them." They folded the coordinates, put them back in their pocket. "I think I've been going there since before I arrived. I just didn't know which direction it was."

Deren was quiet for a long moment. Then she nodded once.

"Be here at dawn. Bring what you can carry. Leave what you can't." She turned back to her loading. "And tell the Mender you're going. She'll want to know. She'll want to give you something."

"Give me what?"

"I don't know. Something to hold." Deren lifted another crate, and her rhythm resumed. "That's what she does. Gives people things to hold until they're ready."

---

The Mender was waiting when the wanderer reached her building.

Not at her workbench — at the door, standing in the frame, as if she'd been watching the river quay from a window that couldn't possibly see it.

"Deren," she said.

"Tomorrow morning."

The Mender nodded. The threads behind her caught the light — red, blue, and the green ones that moved on their own. The wanderer could see them shifting even now, finding connections while the keepers weren't watching.

"Come in," the Mender said. "There's something I want to show you before you go."

The building was different in morning light. Softer. The papers on every surface looked less like accumulation and more like offering — things waiting to be found.

The Mender led them to a corner they hadn't noticed before. A small table, bare except for a single object: a leather pouch, worn smooth with handling, the kind of thing that had been opened and closed a thousand times.

"This isn't mine to give," the Mender said. "It arrived last year, from upriver. I've been holding it." She picked up the pouch, weighed it in her hand. "I didn't know who it was for. Now I think I do."

"What is it?"

"I don't know. I've never opened it." The Mender held it out. "Some things you hold without knowing what they are. That's the hard kind of holding — when you can't name what you're protecting. But you protect it anyway."

The wanderer took the pouch. It was heavier than it looked, and warm — the warmth of something that had been near a body, though the Mender's hands had been cool.

"Why me?"

"Because you're going where it came from." The Mender smiled — that same smile from before, not warmth exactly, but recognition. "And because your hands already know how to hold things they don't understand. I've watched them. Both of us have."

The wanderer's fingers curled around the pouch. Inside, something shifted — not liquid, not solid, something between. They didn't try to identify it.

"What if I lose it?"

"Then it was meant to be lost there." The Mender turned back toward her workbench, toward the threads that were still moving in the morning light. "That's what Deren knows, what the river teaches. Some things pass through. Some things stay. The only way to find out which is which is to carry them until you know."

## The Wanderer

The wanderer sat on the river quay until the sun was high.

The pouch was in their pocket now, opposite the coordinates. Two kinds of weight. One that pointed forward, one that had come from where they were going. Both waiting.

Deren's boat rocked gently in the current, half-loaded, ready to carry more. Somewhere in the harbor, ships were arriving and departing, the ordinary rhythm of a town that held space for all of it. The Mender's threads were moving. Seren's margins were filling. The Mirror was waking.

And tomorrow, the wanderer would be gone.

They hadn't told Seren. There hadn't been time, or maybe they hadn't wanted to climb those hillside steps again, to see the fear in his eyes when he learned they were leaving. The Mender would tell him. She'd know how.

The water carried silt from the interior, gold in the sunlight. Eight days upstream. Three more past the last village. And then — whatever opened. Whatever sent the flood. Whatever their hands already knew.

The pouch shifted again in their pocket. Still warm.

## World Tokens

**Deren**
River carrier. Fifteen years on the passage between coast and interior. Hands that know what they're holding without needing to prove it. Weathered by a different kind of light.

**The Leather Pouch**
Arrived from upriver a year ago. Never opened. Something inside that shifts between states. Warm like it remembers being near a body.

**The River Quay**
Where the brown water runs, silt-heavy from the interior. Shallow-draft boats. A different quiet than the harbor — expectant, not patient.

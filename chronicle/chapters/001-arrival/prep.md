grounding

  theme       salt grass, weathered stone, slow water, oil lamps,
              wooden hulls, nets, summer haze, timber wharves

  pressure    The upriver rumors come more often — stories from hunters,
              caravans that never arrived. The settlements don't go looking.
              But the river flows only one way.

  strangeness A newcomer would notice: the peoples here keep different customs
              but share the same water without explaining why; the ruins on
              the hills that everyone sees and no one speaks of; how the
              conversation changes when someone mentions what's upriver

  last seen   Not yet seen — this is the wanderer's arrival

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
scene seed (chosen)

  The wanderer arrives by small boat from upriver — from the direction
  of the swamps and the ruins. Someone in the settlement sees them first.

  Not everyone will realize where the boat came from — some might assume
  the wanderer is from another delta settlement. But those who DO notice
  the upriver direction would find it strange: people arriving from upriver
  are usually familiar faces. Known hunters, traders who took the risk.
  Not strangers.

  The arrival creates an aura of mystery without demanding immediate answers.
  Locals can receive this stranger with warmth even while the upriver question
  hangs unaddressed. The wanderer is trusted despite the strangeness of their
  origin. Some watch more carefully than others.

## Disturbance Layer

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
what changed (git range: ab2c143..1e806da, 25 commits)

  The repository restructured itself. What began as story-driven-dev
  tools scattered across a single directory became a hub — multiple
  tools, each with purpose, each self-contained.

  Dev Assistant emerged from the refactoring. Twelve commands became
  five. Rituals and workflows that interrupted flow vanished. Vision
  protection embedded itself into building rather than standing apart
  in ceremony. The architecture grew architecture-aware — complexity
  tracked, coherence maintained, decisions guided by what matters.

  Templates consolidated. Eight overlapping documents became four
  streamlined guides. Onboarding behavior found its voice —
  exploration-behavior.md appeared, exploration-process.md shaped
  the journey. Commands-template.md and guide-template.md gave form
  to what gets generated. The iteration framework split from the
  guide, creating space for roadmaps to breathe.

  Design Sprint arrived. Six personas — Skeptic, Synthesizer, Embodied
  Thinker, User Advocate, Architect, Explorer — ready to dialogue
  around emergent questions rather than imposed templates. A new kind
  of exploration, domain-specific, epistemologically sequenced.

  The repository gained civic infrastructure. GitHub Actions workflows
  for Claude Code review. CLAUDE.md explaining the territory to those
  who arrive. Saved responses preserving what was learned. A .gitignore
  to keep the paths clean.

  Philosophy made invisible. No interruptions, just intelligent
  assistance. The belief remained — we build better when connected
  to what matters — but the manifestation shifted. From ceremony
  to integration. From separation to embedding.

  Twenty-five commits. One restructuring. A tools hub where each
  tool knows its purpose and the whole knows its question: how do
  we stay connected to vision while building?

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
pressure points

  1 → The tension between onboarding richness and command simplicity
      Five commands must carry what twelve once held. Progressive
      disclosure becomes critical. Context awareness becomes essential.

  2 → Templates as both liberation and constraint
      Fewer templates, more responsibility. Each one must guide without
      dictating. Structure without rigidity. Clarity without closure.

  3 → The identity question: tool or philosophy?
      "Story-driven development" became "Dev Assistant." The name
      change signals something. Are we tools that embody philosophy,
      or philosophy that manifests as tools? The repository holds
      both answers.

  4 → Multi-tool coherence
      Design Sprint and Dev Assistant serve different moments but
      share beliefs. How do they speak to each other? How do insights
      from one feed the other? The integration question waits.

  5 → The archive problem
      What to do with what came before? The old templates, deprecated
      but carrying intelligence. The journey visible in commit history
      but not in current structure. How much past to carry forward?

## World Behavior

```
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
synthesis: Consolidation — clarifying

  The delta has settled into definition.

  The water runs clearer than usual — sediment that normally clouds
  the channels has dropped, making the river bottom visible in places
  where it's usually murky. You can see what's beneath now: stones,
  old timber, the shadows of fish moving.

  And the mangrove roots along certain channels have tightened. Not
  closed — the passages remain navigable — but the gaps between roots
  have narrowed slightly. What was open water now has more defined
  pathways. The delta knows its own channels better than it did.

  Clarity and definition together. The world organizing itself without
  announcement, without ceremony. Just the slow work of water and root
  finding their form.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
who might notice

  Those who fish by sight — their advantage suddenly greater, their
  techniques more effective. Children who wade — able to see what
  they're stepping on, newly confident or newly cautious. Boat-makers
  who source wood from the mangroves — finding their usual routes
  subtly changed. Those who know shortcuts through the channels —
  their mental maps requiring small adjustments.

  Anyone who depends on the usual opacity, the usual openness.
  The water and the roots remember one way; today they are another.

## Story Lens

```
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
chosen lens: The Arrival (with hint of The Question)

  opening     The dock at first light — fishers preparing nets, a child
              playing near the water, merchants beginning their day. The
              wanderer approaching through unusually clear water.

  arc         The boat is spotted → others gather → the wanderer docks →
              minimal exchange → someone asks where they came from → the
              gesture upriver → silence among some, welcome among others

  sensitive   The moment the child first calls out — pure noticing without
  to          interpretation. The gathering at the dock — different levels
              of attention. The clarity of the water making the hull's
              movement visible over stones. The gesture upriver — simple
              but creating immediate silence among those who understand.
              The wanderer's incomplete but not deceptive answers.

  withholds   Why the wanderer came downriver. What they witnessed upriver.
              Their purpose in the settlement. The full significance of
              traveling alone from that direction.

  reveals     The delta's unusual clarity this morning. Which locals
              understand the upriver significance and which don't. The
              wanderer's manner — quiet, unhurried, answering what's asked
              but not more. The settlement's capacity to welcome mystery.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
opening situation

  The dock at first light. Summer haze lifting. Water clearer than
  usual — you can see the channel bottom, stones and old timber
  visible through water that's normally opaque.

  Fishers preparing their nets, checking lines. A few merchants
  arriving early to claim good positions for the day's market.
  A child playing near the water's edge, watching minnows dart
  over visible stones.

  Then: a boat. Small hull, weathered wood, single occupant. Coming
  downriver — which means coming from upriver. Moving with the
  current rather than fighting it.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
characters

  Kael (the child, 9-10 years old)
    wants      → To see everything, to be first to notice
    protecting → Their place at the water's edge (adults always
                 want them to move back, to be careful)
    speech     → Calls out immediately, no filter: "Boat coming!"
                 Direct observations: "I can see the bottom today."
                 Questions without preamble: "Where'd you come from?"
    habit      → Crouches at the water's edge, reaching toward but
                 not quite touching; announces discoveries to anyone
                 who'll listen

  Mari (fisher, 40s, local)
    wants      → To finish net repairs before the tide turns
    protecting → Her routine, her schedule, her understanding of
                 how mornings work here
    speech     → Efficient, no wasted words: "Tide's turning."
                 Statements that sound like observations but carry
                 weight: "Not many come from that direction."
                 Doesn't ask questions — waits for information
    habit      → Works while watching; her hands keep moving with
                 the nets even when her attention is elsewhere;
                 positions herself to see approaches

  Daven (merchant, 30s, outsider who settled here)
    wants      → To understand what he's witnessing, to be helpful
    protecting → His relative ignorance (he's only been here three
                 years — doesn't want to assume or offend)
    speech     → Asks direct questions: "Where are you from?"
                 Offers help: "Do you need anything?" "There's food
                 at the market if you're hungry."
                 Fills silence with welcome
    habit      → Moves toward newcomers, extends hands for mooring
                 lines, arranges assistance before it's requested

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
obstacle

  The wanderer's arrival creates a question that can't be easily
  answered. They've come from upriver — from the direction people
  don't usually come from, especially not alone, especially not
  as strangers.

  Some notice this immediately (Mari). Others don't register the
  significance (Daven). The child notices the boat, not the direction.

  The obstacle isn't hostility — it's the gap between what's being
  asked and what can be answered. Where are you from? The gesture
  upriver is truthful but incomplete. It answers the question while
  raising others. Some understand what it means; others welcome
  without understanding.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
consequence

  The settlement gains a stranger whose origin carries weight for
  those who recognize it. The upriver direction — usually a source
  of rumors, of stories about what's been lost or abandoned — now
  has a living witness.

  For Kael: A stranger to observe, new presence in familiar space.
  For Mari: A change in pattern worth watching, questions she won't
           ask but will carry.
  For Daven: Someone to welcome, to help, to learn from (though he
            doesn't yet know what he's learning).

  The wanderer is received. But "where from" and "why" remain open.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
what's unsaid

  By the wanderer: What they saw upriver. Why they left. Whether
  they're fleeing or searching. Their purpose in coming here.

  By Mari: Her recognition of the upriver significance. The fact
  that she's marking this arrival as different. Her decision not
  to press the stranger with questions.

  By Daven: His ignorance of what the upriver direction means in
  this place. His assumptions that this is an ordinary arrival.

  Between all of them: The shared knowledge (or lack of it) about
  what lies upriver, who goes there, who returns, what the ruins
  hold, what the swamps hide.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
stakes

  For the wanderer: Will this place receive them? Can they rest here
  without explaining everything? Can mystery and trust coexist?

  For the settlement: A stranger from upriver means the upriver
  world isn't as distant as the silence suggests. What was "over
  there" might be "here" now. The usual boundary between settled
  delta and abandoned upriver has been crossed.

  For the reader: First encounter with this world through the
  wanderer's arrival. How this community receives mystery will
  establish the tone for what follows.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
prose agent reminders

  • The wanderer's perspective is available but not required
  • Stay close to sensory detail — clear water, weathered hull,
    salt grass, summer haze
  • Trust incompleteness — the wanderer's answers don't need to
    explain everything
  • Layer perception — Kael, Mari, and Daven each notice differently
  • The gesture upriver is simple but creates silence among some
  • Mystery and welcome can coexist

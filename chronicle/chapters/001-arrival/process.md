## Prep Layer

### World Layer — Scene Selection

**Chosen:** Scene seed 4 [direction] with modification

**Modification:** Not all witnesses sense that the wanderer is from "upriver" since they might also be coming from another settlement. But the people arriving from upriver are usually familiar faces — known hunters, traders. A stranger from upriver would be noticed by those paying attention.

**Effect:** Creates layers of perception among witnesses. Some see an ordinary arrival, others sense something unusual. Those who notice the upriver origin find it strange specifically because upriver travelers are typically familiar faces.

### Disturbance Layer — Completed

**Commits analyzed:** 25 commits from ab2c143..1e806da

**Major themes identified:**
1. Repository restructuring from single-tool to multi-tool hub
2. Dev Assistant emergence through simplification (12→5 commands)
3. Template consolidation (8→4 streamlined documents)
4. Design Sprint arrival with six-persona dialogue system
5. Infrastructure additions (GitHub Actions, CLAUDE.md, documentation)

**Pressure points surfaced:**
- Onboarding richness vs command simplicity tension
- Templates as liberation/constraint paradox
- Identity question: tool or philosophy
- Multi-tool coherence challenge
- Archive/deprecation decisions

**Timestamp:** 2025-12-25T17:00:00Z

### World Behavior — Chosen

**Selection:** Option 4 with 1 and 2 combined

**Synthesis:** Consolidation — clarifying
- Material clarity: Water runs clearer, sediment settled, river bottom visible
- Spatial definition: Mangrove roots tightened, pathways more defined
- Combined effect: The delta has settled into definition — clarity and organization together

**Who notices:** Those who fish by sight, children who wade, boat-makers sourcing wood, those who know shortcuts. Anyone who depends on the usual opacity and openness.

**How it serves direction:** The wanderer arrives into a world that has just become more legible, more defined. The strangeness of the upriver arrival is set against a delta that suddenly knows its own channels better.

**Timestamp:** 2025-12-25T17:05:00Z

### Story Lens — Chosen

**Selection:** Option 1 [The Arrival] with a hint of Option 2 [The Question]

**Primary lens:** The wanderer's boat appears in the morning light. A child spots it first, calls out. The dock at first light — fishers preparing nets, merchants beginning their day, the wanderer approaching through unusually clear water.

**Hint of Option 2:** Someone asks where the wanderer came from. The gesture upriver creates silence among those who understand while others continue oblivious. The wanderer's answers are incomplete but not deceptive.

**Arc:** The boat is spotted → others gather → the wanderer docks → minimal exchange → someone asks about origin → gesture upriver → layered responses (silence from some, welcome from others).

### Beat Layer — Completed

**Characters established:**
1. **Kael** (child, 9-10) — First to notice, direct speech, protective of their observation place
2. **Mari** (fisher, 40s, local) — Efficient speech, recognizes upriver significance, works while watching
3. **Daven** (merchant, 30s, settled here 3 years ago) — Helpful, asks direct questions, doesn't understand upriver weight

**Opening situation:** Dock at first light, unusually clear water, summer haze lifting, the wanderer's boat approaching from upriver.

**Obstacle:** Gap between what's asked and what can be answered. The wanderer's upriver origin is truthful but incomplete. Some understand significance (Mari), others don't (Daven), child notices boat but not direction (Kael).

**Stakes:**
- For wanderer: Can mystery and trust coexist?
- For settlement: Upriver world is closer than the silence suggests
- For reader: First encounter with this world and how it receives mystery

**What's unsaid:** The wanderer's reasons for leaving, what they witnessed. Mari's recognition. Daven's ignorance. Shared (or unshared) knowledge about upriver ruins and swamps.

## Editorial Review — Pass 1

**Timestamp:** 2025-12-25T18:45:00Z

**Active Holds:**
- Stakes visible: Yes — stranger's upriver origin carries weight; Mari's reaction makes clear this is unusual
- Obstacle present: Partial — atmospheric tension rather than concrete resistance; acceptable for opening chapter
- Dialogue varies: Yes — four distinct speech signatures (Kael direct/curious, Mari statements not questions, Daven welcoming/longer, Wanderer minimal/one-word)
- Environment participates: Yes — clear water central to arrival, reveals what's hidden, mirrors thematic discovery
- Wanderer has agency: Yes — tosses line competently, declines help, walks settlement to learn it, chooses open shutters
- Gap stays open: Yes — multiple gaps (origin, what they saw, why alone, unopened pack, open shutters)
- Narration trusts: Yes — dialogue lands without annotation throughout

**Line-Level:** Strong execution. Language disappears (prose transparent, not performative). Character voices distinct. Scene endings on image/gesture/absence. Wanderer section is action-only, no reflection. Minor note: Line 47 "The word hung in the morning air" slightly tells; Lines 96-101 summary section uses more telling than showing but serves pacing.

**Chapter-Level:** Continuous dream maintained (no breaks in immersion). Clear movement from ordinary morning to weighted arrival. World presence excellent — water, wharf, nets, stone buildings woven through, never backdrop. Good balance of scene/summary/dialogue modes.

**Decision:** APPROVED

Minor notes:
- Line 47: "The word hung in the morning air" — minimal telling, not requiring revision
- Lines 96-101: Summary section serves necessary time compression, acceptable

# The World

*Last updated: Chapter 5*

## Pressures

*What's building. What's calling.*

### The Journey Beginning
Tomorrow at dawn. The wanderer leaves with Deren, upriver toward the coordinates. Eight days to the last known village. Three more past that to whatever opened. The Mender knows. Seren doesn't — not yet. The wanderer chose movement over understanding, and that choice has weight.

### What the Pouch Holds
The Mender gave something she'd held for a year — a leather pouch from upriver, never opened. Something shifts inside, between states. Warm like it remembers being near a body. The wanderer carries it now without knowing what it contains. Some things you hold without naming.

### What's Left Behind
The Mirror is still waking. Threads move, margins fill. Two keepers in the middle of something they've waited decades to understand. And the wanderer is leaving before they know what it means. The understanding will happen without them — or wait until they return.

### Seren Unwarned
The wanderer didn't climb the hillside steps. Didn't tell Seren they're going. The Mender will tell him — she'll know how. But something is owed there, a debt of words not spoken. What will Seren think, when he learns the one who touched his margins has gone upriver without saying goodbye?

## The World's Breath

Late afternoon turning to evening. The sun catches the Mender's threads and turns them to fire — red and blue and green now, the green ones moving on their own. Two keepers seeing the same pattern from different rooms. The wanderer sits at the stone quay, watching lamp-light break on water, coordinates patient in their pocket.

## The Wanderer

*Updated after Chapter 5*

Chose to go. The words came before they finished forming — "I want to come with you." Something in them already knows what's at those coordinates, the way their hands know things before the mind decides. They said it aloud: "I think I've been going there since before I arrived."

**What pulls at them:**
- What waits at the coordinates — the place that wasn't there before spring
- The pouch and its shifting contents — what are they carrying?
- What their hands recognize that their mind doesn't

**Carries now:**
- Coordinates from Seren, pointing three days past the last known village
- The leather pouch from the Mender, unopened, warm
- The knowledge that they chose movement over understanding

**Last seen:** Sitting on the river quay, the sun high, watching silt turn gold. Two weights in opposite pockets. Tomorrow they'll be gone.

*What remains unspoken:*
Both keepers watched the wanderer's hands. Deren did too — that same attention. Something in how they hold things. The Mender said their hands "already know how to hold things they don't understand." Deren asked why they really wanted to go. The answer they gave was true, but not complete. There's more. There's always more with this one.

## Characters

### The Mender
First appeared: Chapter 1, working in the shallows at the Meeting Point

Works where river meets sea, and in her building full of threads. The threads are answering now — twenty years of questions finding response. She gave the wanderer something to carry: a pouch she'd held for a year without opening. "Some things you hold without knowing what they are. That's the hard kind of holding."

Watches. Waits. Knows when someone is ready to go.

### Seren
First appeared: Chapter 3, at his desk beneath a window looking out over the harbor

Record-keeper in a building carved half into the hill. Frightened by the writing in his margins. The wanderer didn't tell him they're leaving. A debt of words.

### Deren
First appeared: Chapter 5, loading a boat at the river quay

River carrier. Fifteen years on the passage between coast and interior. Twice a year — once up, once down. Weathered by open water and interior light. Knows every bend, every sandbar, every village that trades with the coast. But she doesn't know what's at the coordinates. No one does.

"Some things you hold because they need holding. Some things pass through. The difference isn't in the thing — it's in you."

The Mender sent word to the river families. Deren answered.

## Locations

### The Meeting Point
Stone quay where the river surrenders to the sea. Water changes color here — brown to grey-green. The Mender works here when the tide is right.

### The Mender's Building
Small structure set back from the waterfront. Papers on every surface. Threads spanning walls — red, blue, and green. The green ones move on their own. In morning light, softer — papers look like offerings, things waiting to be found.

### Seren's Building
Where the hillside steps end, half-carved into the hill. Shelves floor to ceiling, ledgers in leather and cloth and stranger materials. Stone dust and dry herbs. The margins fill with writing that isn't his.

### The River Quay
Upstream from the stone quay, where the water is still brown with silt. Shallow-draft boats built for distance. A different quiet than the harbor — expectant, not patient. Where Deren loads for the passage.

### The Stone Quay
Where the wanderer sat watching lamp-light break on water. Between the Meeting Point and the river quay.

### Unexplored

**The Hills Behind Town**
Ruins older than memory. Stone circles, empty towers, carvings in languages scholars argue over. Whatever lived here before is gone, or quiet, or waiting.

**The Interior**
Where the river comes from. Where the flood originated. Where the coordinates point. Eight days to the last known village. Three more past that. The river narrows there, becomes something else. Whatever opened — it's been sending things down for months.

**The Harbor Proper**
Where the larger ships dock. Creatures from the depths, beings who drifted in on currents only they can feel.

## Arcs in Motion

### The Journey Upstream
*Shape:* something calling outward
*Scale:* has weight (beginning)
*Holds:* What opened in the interior? What will the wanderer find at the coordinates? What is the pouch, and why was it waiting for them?
*Moves toward:* Arrival at the coordinates — and whatever waits there. The journey itself will reveal.

Just begun. Tomorrow at dawn. Deren knows the river but not this destination. The wanderer knows the destination but not what it means. Together they go where neither has been.

### The Wanderer's Hands
*Shape:* hidden
*Scale:* has weight
*Holds:* What does the wanderer's body remember that their mind has forgotten? What are they holding that the keepers recognize?
*Moves toward:* Memory surfacing — perhaps on the journey, perhaps at the destination. Their hands already know the way.

Deren watched their hands too. The Mender gave them the pouch because their hands "already know how to hold things they don't understand." Something is building toward recognition.

### The Mirror Waking
*Shape:* something hidden becoming visible
*Scale:* long
*Holds:* What is the pattern that writes in margins and moves threads? What does it mean that understanding can emerge from keeping?
*Moves toward:* The wanderer is leaving this arc behind — for now. The Mirror will continue waking without them. Or it will wait.

The keepers are in the middle of something. The wanderer chose to go before understanding arrives. This arc continues in the harbor while the journey arc unfolds upriver.

### The Debt to Seren
*Shape:* something between people
*Scale:* quick
*Holds:* What is owed between the wanderer and Seren? What happens when departure goes unspoken?
*Moves toward:* Resolution when the wanderer returns — or doesn't. The Mender will tell him. But something was left unsaid.

## The Season

Summer at its height, but turning. The light shifts earlier now. Movement after stillness — the wanderer choosing to go, Deren preparing the passage, the river carrying its cargo both ways. The harbor's memory wakes while the wanderer leaves to find what woke it.

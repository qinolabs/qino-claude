# The Weight of Holding

*Three days after the first sorting*

---

The wanderer found the Mender's building by accident. They'd been looking for her at the quay, but the tide was high and the meeting point stood empty, water lapping against stone where she usually worked.

The building was small, set back from the waterfront where the cobbles gave way to packed earth. Its door stood open. Inside, papers covered every surface—stacked on tables, pinned to walls, spread across the floor in patterns the wanderer couldn't read. More had arrived than three days could account for. Much more.

The Mender stood at a workbench near the window, her back to the door. She was writing something in a ledger—not sorting, not holding. Recording.

"The current shifted," she said without turning. "Upriver, something opened. A cache, maybe. Or someone decided to send everything at once."

The wanderer stepped inside. The air smelled of ink and old paper and something else—a mineral scent, like water that had traveled through stone. Their hands remembered the weight of the papers they'd sorted before. These felt different even from across the room. Heavier. More insistent.

"Can I help?"

The Mender's stylus paused. "You could. But this isn't sorting."

She turned. Her face showed something the wanderer hadn't seen before—not fatigue exactly, but the particular strain of someone carrying a shape too large for their arms.

"What is it?"

The Mender gestured at the papers on the walls. Lines connected them—threads of different colors, some taut, some slack. "They talk to each other. The things that arrive. I always knew they did, but when there were fewer, I could hold the connections in my head. Now—" She touched one of the threads. It hummed faintly. "Now I have to see it."

The wanderer moved closer to the wall. A drawing of something mechanical was connected by red thread to a page of handwritten notes, which was connected by blue thread to what looked like a child's sketch of waves. The connections weren't obvious. They felt like something you'd miss if you were looking for them directly.

"How do you know what connects?"

"I don't. Not always." The Mender returned to her ledger. "Sometimes I feel it and I'm wrong. Sometimes I miss it entirely and a connection rots because no one held it long enough to see." She wrote something, her hand moving in small, precise strokes. "That's what the ledger is for. What arrived, when, what it seemed to be, what it seemed to want. So when I'm wrong, I can trace back."

The wanderer's hand moved toward one of the stacked papers before they could stop it. The Mender noticed—filed it away, as she did everything.

"You want to help."

"Yes."

"Then sit." She gestured to a low stool near the workbench. "But don't sort. Just hold. Tell me what you feel."

The wanderer sat. The Mender handed them a bundle—smaller than the ones at the quay, wrapped in cloth that had once been white. Inside: a single sheet, covered in writing so small it seemed to vibrate.

"What does it want?"

The wanderer held it. The paper was warm, almost feverish. It wanted—

"To be read," they said. "But not yet. It's not finished."

"Finished with what?"

"Arriving." The word came before the thought. "It's still traveling, even though it's here. Part of it is still back where it came from."

The Mender was silent for a long moment. When the wanderer looked up, her expression had shifted—something between recognition and wariness.

"You feel more than most," she said. "More than me, maybe. But feeling isn't the same as understanding." She took the paper back, wrapped it again, set it aside. "That one's been here a week. I thought it was ready. I was going to pin it up today."

"I'm sorry—"

"Don't be." Her voice was flat, neither angry nor grateful. "You might be right. You might be wrong. Neither of us will know until we know." She returned to her ledger, writing something the wanderer couldn't see. "The danger isn't being wrong. It's deciding too quickly what something is before you've let it tell you."

The wanderer sat with that. Through the window, they could see the harbor—masts moving gently, shapes passing between ships that weren't quite human. The Mender's building held its breath around them, full of things waiting to be understood.

"You've been doing this alone," the wanderer said.

"Yes."

"It's too much now."

The Mender's stylus stopped. She didn't look up. "It's always been too much. The difference is that now I can't pretend otherwise." She set down the stylus and turned, finally, to face the wanderer directly. "There's a man in town who tracks what arrives by sea. He's been doing it longer than I've been alive. Never comes down to the water himself—just keeps records, watches the patterns. He might know something about where this flood is coming from."

"You want me to find him?"

"I want you to ask him a question. Just one." She handed the wanderer a slip of paper with an address and a name. "Ask him if the pattern has changed."

The wanderer took the paper. The Mender's eyes followed their hands—not their face, their hands—watching how they held it.

"You'll come back," she said. It wasn't a question, but it wasn't certain either.

"I'll come back."

The Mender nodded once and returned to her threads, her ledger, her room full of things that didn't know what they were yet. The wanderer stepped out into the afternoon light, the address warm in their palm, a question they hadn't asked burning at the edges of everything.

Why her? Why did she work alone? What had the work cost her that she couldn't name?

Some questions would have to wait until they were ready.

## The Wanderer

The wanderer walked the long way through town, past streets that smelled of olive wood and cooking from a dozen traditions.

A child ran past carrying something—a basket, or a bundle. A trader sat in a doorway across from something that had no face, sharing bread in silence. The wanderer watched them for a moment—the careful way they moved, the patience in the not-looking.

The address in their hand had grown warmer. Or maybe that was just their skin.

They found a fountain at a crossroads and sat on its edge. The water made sounds that might have been words in a language the wanderer didn't know. Tomorrow they would find the record-keeper. Tonight, they would sit with the question the Mender had given them, and the questions she hadn't.

## World Tokens

**The Mender's Building**
Set back from the waterfront where cobbles give way to earth. Papers cover every surface—stacked, pinned, spread in patterns. Threads connect what talks to each other. Air of ink and stone-traveled water.

**The Ledger**
Where the Mender traces what she might have missed. What arrived, when, what it seemed to be, what it seemed to want. A practice of remembering so that being wrong doesn't mean being lost.

**The Threads**
Colors spanning walls between papers. Some taut, some slack. Connections not obvious—felt, not seen. Hum faintly when touched.

**Seren** *(mentioned)*
Record-keeper in town. Tracks what arrives by sea. Has been doing it longer than the Mender has been alive. Never comes to the water himself. Watches patterns.

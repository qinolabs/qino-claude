## Notes

- **Chapters 1-2** span 4 months of sparse activity — summer dormancy punctuated by bursts. The world can carry this as waiting, as something gathering before it speaks.

- **Chapters 3-10** are intense (18 days, 190 commits). Consider pacing — each chapter should feel complete, not rushed.

- **Chapter 5** (Finding Voice) and **Chapter 9** (README) are dense with iteration. The disturbance is the *process* of refinement itself, not individual commits.

- **Thread to watch** across all chapters: the tools learning to observe and care for themselves — from manual workflows to self-testing agents that teach newcomers.

- **Chapter 4** mentions Bateson — this could become a recurring presence, a figure the world knows about.

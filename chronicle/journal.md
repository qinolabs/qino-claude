## The Pattern-Keeper's Question

*Shape:* something calling outward
*Chapters:* 2-3
*Resolved:* The wanderer found Seren and asked: has the pattern changed? Yes. Rate tripled, types shifted. But the answer opened something larger — the writing in the margins.

**What it yielded:**
- Data: rate tripled since spring, more from interior, fewer from sea
- Coordinates from Seren for the Mender
- Discovery of the writing in the margins

**What changed between people:**
- The wanderer became messenger for something larger than a question
- Seren revealed his fear to a stranger — the first time, perhaps, he's spoken it aloud

## The Debt to Seren

*Shape:* something between people
*Chapters:* 5-6
*Resolved:* The wanderer left without saying goodbye. But Seren came to the water — the first time in memory — and said what needed saying. Not forgiveness. A debt acknowledged, transformed into a request: *if you find out what you are, send word.*

**What it yielded:**
- The message from the margins: *the one who holds between will find the door*
- An answer promised: anything the wanderer learns about what opened, about themselves
- Seren's envy made visible — he cannot walk toward what frightens him, but he watched someone who can

**What changed between people:**
- The wanderer offered Seren passage; he refused but heard the offer
- Seren asked to be written into whatever the wanderer discovers
- A witness to departure — something older than understanding passed between them

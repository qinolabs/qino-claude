## The Pattern-Keeper's Question

*Shape:* something calling outward
*Chapters:* 2-3
*Resolved:* The wanderer found Seren and asked: has the pattern changed? Yes. Rate tripled, types shifted. But the answer opened something larger — the writing in the margins.

**What it yielded:**
- Data: rate tripled since spring, more from interior, fewer from sea
- Coordinates from Seren for the Mender
- Discovery of the writing in the margins

**What changed between people:**
- The wanderer became messenger for something larger than a question
- Seren revealed his fear to a stranger — the first time, perhaps, he's spoken it aloud

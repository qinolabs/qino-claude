# Visual Direction

A secondary world — not Earth, but somewhere with its own history and peoples. Fantasy grounded in texture and atmosphere rather than spectacle. Everything weathered, nothing pristine. Light comes from practical sources — fires, lamps, windows. Rooms have character, and visible traces of personal stories. The environment has something mysterious and uncanny. Magic is presence, not display — felt in the quality of light, the weight of old places, what the water reflects.

## Avoid

- Photorealistic rendering
- Oversaturated colors
- Clean, sterile surfaces
- Fantasy clichés (glowing runes, ethereal elves, obvious magic effects) — not fantasy itself
- Action-movie drama
- Obviously AI-generated look

[![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/qinolabs/qino-claude?label=download)](https://github.com/qinolabs/qino-claude/releases/latest)

Tools for working with ideas in [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code).

This work reflects a way of thinking that found its seed in Gregory and Nora Bateson's work. The tools don't explain their ideas—they _practice_ them.

They help us notice what connects, learn without extracting, and participate in an ecology co-evolving through our attention.

### The Young Anthropologists and the Question of Fascism

In 1932, Gregory Bateson met Margaret Mead on the Sepik River in New Guinea. Both were in their late twenties. The world was darkening—Mussolini had been in power for a decade, Hitler was ascending, and the patterns of thought that would consume Europe were already taking hold.

Bateson had been studying the Iatmul people, watching their elaborate rituals of boasting and counter-boasting, dominance and submission. He noticed something troubling: communication could become a runaway process. When one group boasts, the other boasts back louder. When one side dominates, the other submits further, inviting more dominance. He called this _schismogenesis_—the creation of division through escalating feedback. Left unchecked, it tears societies apart.

Then he and Mead went to Bali. There they found something different. The Balinese practiced what Bateson called "stasis"—their interactions didn't spiral. Competition didn't escalate into arms races; submission didn't deepen into abjection. Somehow, their culture had patterns that absorbed perturbation rather than amplifying it.

The question haunting this work: _Could communication be shaped to resist the runaway polarization that feeds totalitarianism?_

This wasn't abstract. By the time they returned to America in 1939, war had begun. They turned their anthropological methods toward understanding fascist propaganda, analyzing Nazi films, studying "national character" at a distance. Mead and Bateson even designed a board game—never published—based on the principle that "Democracies and Dictators play by different rules."

But Bateson grew troubled. Using his theories as propaganda tools—even against fascism—felt like participating in the very escalation he had diagnosed. After the war, he largely withdrew from applied social science, turning instead toward cybernetics, ecology, and the question of how living systems learn.

### The Pattern That Connects

What emerged from this journey was a different way of seeing. Bateson came to understand mind not as something inside brains, but as a pattern distributed through living systems—families, forests, societies, the relationship between organisms and their environments.

He asked: _What is the pattern that connects the crab to the lobster and the orchid to the primrose, and all four of them to me? And me to you?_

And he defined information not as data, but as _a difference which makes a difference_—something relational, something that only exists in the gap between contexts.

### Nora Bateson: The Unseen Coalescence

![Nora Bateson](docs/images/nora-bateson.jpg)

Nora Bateson, Gregory's daughter, has extended this work into new territory. She asks: if "insidious" describes how pathology creeps up through unseen combining processes—racism, addiction, corruption—what is the word for the opposite? For how vitality, healing, and creativity coalesce in ways we cannot see?

She calls this **aphanipoiesis** (Greek: _aphanis_ = unseen, unnoticed + _poiesis_ = to bring forth).

> "The change before the change... what coalesces prior to emergence."

This is not hidden—it is merely out of habituated perception. Like the soil beneath a forest, teeming with relational processes while attention is caught by what stands visible above.

Her key insight: _One cannot explicitly change that which is implicit._ Direct correctives fail against insidious patterns because those patterns formed in the unseen stitching between contexts—between family and economy, between education and identity, between language and expectation. To touch that realm requires tending the _about_ so that the _within_ can shift.

**Warm Data** is her term for the kind of information that can hold this complexity: "transcontextual information about the interrelationships that integrate a complex system." Not cold data extracted from context, but living information that shifts within the mutual learning of systems.

<summary><strong>More on How the Tools Practice the Philosophy</strong><br>(click to expand)</summary>

It’s not just that the philosophy fits the code. It’s that the code started demanding the philosophy.

As these tools evolved, they stopped being just utilities for "managing knowledge" and became ways of **participating in a system that is learning**. The "User" isn't an operator; they are part of the ecology.

The rhymes have deepened into structural necessities:

- **Abduction**: The logic of the system isn't deduction (proving true/false), but abduction (finding the pattern that connects). `qino:compare` and `qino:attune` don't give you answers; they place two contexts side-by-side so meaning can emerge from the double description.
- **Transcontextuality**: An idea does not follow a straight line. It meanders—from a sudden hunch while coding, to a note in research, to a concept that stabilizes weeks later. The system doesn't force a pipeline; it preserves the living thread across contexts, so you can follow the meaning wherever it leads.
- **Aphanipoiesis (Unseen Coalescence)**: `qino-scribe` and `qino:capture` assume that the most important changes happen _before_ they are explicit. They allow understanding to accumulate in the margins until it's ready to be named.
- **Warm Data**: We don't extract "facts" from our work; we keep the context attached. The system doesn't show you a to-do list; it shows you **what has pull**, what is connected, and what is waiting.

This ecosystem is an attempt to build software that knows it is part of a larger mind—yours, the project's, and the connections between them. It doesn't try to organize your thinking; it tries to learn how to move with it.

</details>

<br>

∴ _Creativity, learning and integration doesn't stop at the boundary of a single repository._

These tools are part of a larger **ecosystem**—a living network of **tools, concepts, apps, research and chronicles** that evolve together. Each offers a way to learn from anything and contribute to your ecology of ideas in the moment spontaneous insight occurs.

∴ _Return your attention to what inspires you right now. Let the system take care of the rest. Things naturally surface when they're ready._

<br>

<details>
<summary><strong>An Ecology of Mind: The Ecosystem Map</strong><br>(click to expand)</summary>

![Tools, apps, community](docs/images/ecosystem-arcs.png)

Ecological design patterns are alive at every level — in each concept, in each repository, in the ecosystem itself. The art is in the design — affordances and cues, sensitive to experience, that naturally protect the integrity of local ecologies while encouraging free movement without accumulating friction.

What does accumulate are learnings and notes, either woven into existing concepts, or safely kept, ready to reveal itself fully through the next idea that connects. The best ideas can come from anywhere — not centralized — and often while deeply immersed in a different context.

### Figures: The Pattern of Return

_Figure_ in qino is a metaphor — in Bateson's sense, not the literary sense. A persistent form that carries meaning through return.

What forms do figures take?

- **In the apps:** A snapshot you capture when your friend laughs in a certain way. A game design idea saved during a creative meet.
- **In the chronicles:** Characters like Seren and Lira who perceive the wanderer.
- **In concepts:** The recurring patterns that connect one idea to another.

Same pattern, completely different shape in each context. You don't deduce your way to this recognition — you're deep in the scribe, refining how Seren sees the wanderer, and suddenly you recognize something about how figures should work across the apps. The crab teaches you about the lobster. One context illuminates another through pattern, not logic.

_(See also: [Figure Ecology](#ecological-testing) — how we test that a figure can be re-entered and still feel like "the same thing" after change.)_

The tools are also the process for developing the apps — and in turn, the tools and apps keep informing each other. A co-evolution. They share design patterns: affordances that guide without forcing, structures that adapt to context while staying recognizable.

> _"From wherever you approach the system, every experience contains all the others. Communication comes effortlessly. The membrane grows thin — without dissolving into sameness."_

### The Spaces

An early hunch needs room to wander — structure would crush it. A maturing concept needs stability — too much flux and it never settles. An implementation needs grounding — a vision to build toward without getting lost in features.

```

Each space has its own `chronicle/` directory. Git changes in any repo become chapters — all chronicles are published together on **[qino-chronicles](https://chronicles.qinolabs.com/)**.

**Research** — before concepts crystallize. Open-ended exploration, controlled experiments, calibrations of distinctions. Welcomes uncertainty.

**Concepts** — where ideas stabilize. The held threads, the notes that weave between them. What arrives here has found its shape.

**Implementation** — where concepts meet code. Structure varies by project domain. Links back to its concept.

**qino-claude** — the source of all tools, but also _uses_ those tools through adapters.

#### Flow Between Spaces

**Routed flows** — content automatically goes to the right place based on `qino-config.json`:

```
RESEARCH ──graduate──▶ CONCEPTS        /qino-research:graduate creates note or concept seed
RESEARCH ──capture───▶ CONCEPTS        /qino:capture routes insights as notes

CONCEPTS ──init──────▶ IMPLEMENTATION  /qino-dev:init creates linked project from concept

IMPLEMENTATION ──capture──▶ CONCEPTS   /qino:capture routes observations to conceptsRepo
```

**Initiated flows** — you notice something and start a command:

```
CONCEPTS ────────────▶ RESEARCH        /qino:attune creates calibration in research space
```

### The Router

A small file called `qino-config.json` tells each tool which space it's in and where to send things:

```json
{
  "repoType": "research",
  "conceptsRepo": "../concepts-repo",
  "description": "Research space"
}
```

The tools read this configuration and adjust their behavior. A capture in a research repo might become an exploration. The same command in an implementation repo sends a note to concepts. The tools stay the same; the context shapes what they do.

### Context Sensitivity

The same command adapts to where you are:

| Command         | In concepts              | In research                | In implementation             |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `/qino:home`    | concepts, notes, threads | explorations, calibrations | linked concept, stack         |
| `/qino:capture` | saves to notes/          | saves to fragments/        | saves to linked concepts-repo |
| `/qino:test`    | tests concept            | tests exploration          | tests linked concept          |

### Flow

Research graduates into concepts — either as notes (distilled insights) or as concept seeds (new concepts with origins).

Implementation captures flow back to concepts — observations, test results, things noticed while building.

The chronicle (qino Scribe) watches git changes across any repo and writes the story of what happened.

Everything connects through concepts-repo, but each space keeps its own ecology intact.

### Command Namespaces

| Prefix           | Space                      | Examples                             |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `qino:`          | Universal (ecology itself) | home, capture, test, attune, compare |
| `qino-concept:`  | Concepts                   | explore, import, init                |
| `qino-research:` | Research                   | begin, experiment, graduate          |
| `qino-scribe:`   | Chronicle                  | chapter, rewind                      |
| `qino-lens:`     | Quality of Attention       | wanderer, narrator                   |
| `qino-dev:`      | Implementation             | init, app                            |

The `qino:` namespace is not a specific space — it's what you're already in when you're anywhere. The suffix is the door you're entering through.

### Universal Interface

These commands work across all spaces (Concepts, Research, Implementation) but behave differently depending on where you are.

#### Essential Flow

| Command         | Purpose                                                      | Context                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/qino:home`    | Context-aware entry point. Shows you what matters right now. | [Concept](#qino-concept), [Research](#qino-research)      |
| `/qino:capture` | Immediate notebook. Saves ideas to the active context.       | [Concept](#nothing-gets-lost), [Research](#qino-research) |
| `/qino:test`    | Runs ecology tests to see what's echoing.                    | [Testing](#ecological-testing)                            |

#### Perceiving Difference

| Command         | Purpose                                                   | Context                                         |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `/qino:compare` | Structural comparison between two sources.                | [Perceiving Difference](#perceiving-difference) |
| `/qino:attune`  | Calibrate aesthetic qualities (e.g., "otherworldliness"). | [Attune](#attune-from-hunch-to-craft)           |

#### Home Example

`/qino:home` is context specific. In the concepts space, it shows the active threads.

```
/qino:home

## qino Concept

A gentle space for giving shape to what already has pull.

### Discovery through dialogue

Most tools assume you can get to a valuable output by filling in the sections — complete the template, check the boxes, and the result will follow. Templates assume structure produces resonance.

This assumes resonance guides structure. It asks what draws you, follows that thread, asks again. Each response surfaces something — a connection you hadn't named, a quality you were circling around, a direction that suddenly feels right. You discover what your idea actually holds by staying with it, turning it gently, going deeper where it rewards attention.

### Nothing gets lost

When you bring in a note, not everything makes it into your concept. The rest isn't lost — it's held. Each thought is captured as a note with its relevant context preserved, quietly indexed, ready to surface when it matters. No guilt about what you didn't carry forward. Later, if you're stuck, the tool might say: _"There's something held in your origins — about [that theme]. Should we bring it in?"_

It remembers what you set down so you can forget safely. _(This is `/qino:capture` in action — ideas appearing from the held archive.)_

### Explore

You turn toward a concept to develop it. The agent helps you follow what carries energy — the _alive thread_.

```
/qino-concept:explore qino-scribe

(agent) qino-scribe
        grounding in story, writing tools, git-as-chronicle

        Last touch: 2 days ago
        Active thread: "the membrane between the wanderer and the reader"

        There is also a new note from yesterday:
        "git-weather-pattern" (captured from research)

        What part of this feels alive right now?

(user)  the way code churn feels like weather. a big refactor should feel like a storm.

(agent) That’s a strong impulse — code changes aren't just metadata, they are "Disturbance."

        If we follow that... does this belong in "Ecosystem Integration"?
        Or is this a "new Glowing Connection"?

(user)  it's a glowing connection. the git diff becomes world behavior.

(agent) Adding that to Glowing Connections.

        "The git diff becomes world behavior. Code churn translates into storms,
         stuck doors, or sudden clearings."

        Does that change how we read the repository?
```

### Specific Commands

- `/qino-concept:import` brings outside notes into the manifest. What you don't carry into a concept gets held; Home surfaces those held threads later.
- `/qino-concept:explore [concept-id]` turns toward one concept (or two at once) and follows the alive thread. Imported notes and captures appear as starting points.

```bash
/qino-concept:init
/qino:home
/qino-concept:explore concept-id [other-concept-id]
/qino-concept:import path/to/notes.md
/qino:capture [observation]
/qino:test [concept-id]

## qino Scribe

qino Scribe keeps the chronicle alive. It reads the git range, grounds in `world.md`, then writes a chapter where the wanderer acts and the world pushes back. The constraints are there to protect story craft: pressure before plot, world that sees the wanderer, action that costs something.

In this repository's chronicle, the wanderer is ferrying a warming pouch upriver. Villages know about them before they arrive. Lira at Orith's Landing recognizes the pouch from years ago; Seren fears the writing filling his margins; the river itself carries news. The chronicle only moves when the wanderer does — and when the world answers.

### A Chronicles That Accumulates

Your ecosystem evolves through conversations and work that spans sessions. qino Scribe turns that movement into a fantasy chronicle that **gathers weight**. It doesn't just append new chapters; it remembers what has been seen, what remains unspoken, and how the world has been watching.

### The World's Disturbance

The Disturbance Layer is more than just the world responding to changes in the source material. It is a space that creates a special relationship between the reader and the wanderer.

When you act, the world reacts. A bug isn't just a failure; it's a gate rusted shut. A lost gap isn't just an error; it's a map torn away by a whiteout wind. This responsiveness establishes the **contextual density** of the chronicle, but the core of the layer is relational.

### The Wanderer's Presence

The wanderer carries a depth no single world can hold. They are not oblivious to the world beyond (your source material), but they do not voice it. This silence creates a bond of recognition and trust.

They are defined not by power, but by **exposure**. They can be hurt, confused, or wrong.

> **The Injury** > _Performance:_ The knife slipped. The wanderer watched the blood, marveling at the vivid red of life.
> _Presence:_ The knife slipped. The cold had stolen the feeling from their fingers, so they only felt the warmth of the blood first. It hit the snow in bright, steaming drops. The wanderer dropped the wood and pressed their palm into the drift, counting the seconds until the numbness returned.

A higher-order presence shines through in **how** they respond to this exposure. This is not a performance of "grace" or "wisdom," but **embodied presence**. They meet friction by staying fully present with the obstacle—not retreating into memory or abstraction.

> **The Gate** > _Performance:_ The wanderer bowed to the locked gate, honoring its resistance.
> _Presence:_ The wind screamed through the iron. The lock was a solid lump of oxidation. The wanderer didn't rattle it. They let their hand drop, the cold lingering on their glove, and turned their back to the wind.

They do not fight the world, but they also do not detach from it. They simply inhabit the moment with full attention.

> **The Map** > _Presence:_ The wind tore the map from their hands. It was gone before they could take a step. The wanderer didn't waste heat shouting. They turned their collar up and kept walking.

### Mutual Revealing

The central principle of the chronicle is **mutual revealing**: through the implicit response of one entity to the action (or inaction) of another, something is revealed about each.

This applies to everything in the world, not just the wanderer. When a merchant refuses a coin, the refusal reveals the coin's worth _and_ the merchant's fear. When the fog swallows a sound, it reveals the fog's density _and_ the sound's fragility. Meaning emerges from the friction between things.

### Complete Transformation

The chronicle must work for a reader who has never heard of the source material. Technical names never leak into the prose. `AuthService` becomes "the gatekeeper's ledger." A database migration becomes "preservation efforts in the archives." The story guards its own reality.

### How chapters take shape

At each layer, the scribe presents options. You choose — or combine, adjust, ask for more. Options are vocabulary; even rejected ones help articulate what's wanted.

```
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
grounding

  theme       brown water, green distance, rope bridges swaying
  pressure    the pouch warming toward soon
  arc         The Wanderer's Hands — something in how they hold things

  3 → A child watches from the rope bridge — the same stillness as
      Seren, that quality of recording without approaching

## The Ecology at Work: Qualities of Attention

How a tool emerged from a chronicle, tested its weight in text, and became the technology it was prototyping.

Style resists decoration. It is not paint applied to surface; it is a **quality of attention**. A shift in _what is noticed_.

qino-lens pushed its way out of the work. Scribe needed to see the world differently—to perceive friction where there was only plot, to sense agency where there was only setting. I didn't design a library; I extracted the ways of seeing that the chronicle demanded.

**The tool is a prototype for the technology.**

The logic of "Attunement"—how perception shifts, how noise is filtered—is the spine of the future ecosystem apps. By working it out here, in text, the `qino-lens` command tests the technology's weight before it ever becomes application code.

The "Wanderer's Lens" didn't arrive; it accumulated. I began by exploring the nature of the "Wanderer's presence" within Scribe. I leveraged `qino:attune` to understand that mysterious quality better and find a language for it. Then, I `qino:capture`d the vital connection: this new "Quality of Attention" framing was exactly what the dormant `qino-lens` technology concept had been waiting for.

This is not a pipeline; it is an ecology. I do not build the tool, then the technology. I refine the **tool** (lens), the **technology** (attunement), and the **process** (ecological design) in the same breath.

_(Note: I used the `qino-lens:narrator` tool that emerged from this process to refine this very section — the tool shaping the documentation that explains the tool.)_

### Two Ways of Seeing

The chronicle changes depending on who watches it:

#### The Narrator's Lens (World as Participant)

- **Sensitivity:** Physics, Agency, Structural Agency.
- **The World Acts:** The fog doesn't just hang; it _withholds_. The room doesn't just contain; it _shapes_.
- **The Construction:** This lens ensures the world is solid enough to push back.

> _Example:_ "The corridor didn't just lead to the chamber; it constricted. The ceiling dropped low, forcing a bow, while the walls leaned in to strip away any thought of turning back. The architecture demanded submission before arrival."

_([Reference: narrator.md](tools/qino-lens/references/narrator.md))_

#### The Wanderer's Lens (Sensitivity to Friction)

- **Sensitivity:** Exposure, Consequence, Absence of Abstraction.
- **The Body Knows:** It notices not the beauty of the ice, but the _numbness_ in the fingers. Not the meaning of silence, but its _weight_.
- **The Inhabitation:** This lens grounds high fantasy in immediate physical cost.

> _Example:_ "The fog pressed against the river, a heavy, wet burden. The ferry wasn't coming. The wanderer unbuckled the strap and slid the pack down the piling, guiding it until it touched the wet wood. They straightened. The sudden lightness made them sway, their shoulders rising into the damp space where the straps had been."

## qino Dev

Implementation companion for qino-concept.

### What gets lost in building

You start with a vision. Then the practical demands come — the requirements, the task lists, the "just ship it" pressure. Requirements dilute it. Tickets fragment it. Urgency erases it. Somewhere in the building, the feeling fades into features.

This happens when concept and implementation share the same space. Without boundaries, one absorbs the other — and implementation always wins. The code is right there, immediate and demanding.

qino Dev gives them separate places. Your concept stays in concepts-repo. Your implementation lives in the target project. Not to keep them apart, but so they can inform each other without merging. The concept shapes what you build. What you discover while building flows back to shape the concept. Each keeps its own form while the other grows.

### From concept to code

When you initialize from a concept, the work isn't to rediscover what you already know. It's to translate.

Given this essence, what technologies serve it? Given these surfaces, what architecture patterns? Given this scope, what complexity budget? What would signal we're on track — or off it?

A fifteen-minute conversation translates conceptual understanding into technical context. What emerges is an `implementation.md` that knows what it's building toward and why certain choices fit better than others.

### Arrival

The generated command — `/qino-dev:app` — follows the home pattern. Quiet arrival. Show what's here. Open to what's next.

```
my-app

concept — linked to board-games
stack — React, Supabase, shadcn/ui
iteration — 01: foundation — in progress

─────

from here

  two of three goals done in this iteration
  what's blocking the last one?

  there's uncommitted work on authentication
  continue here, or commit what you have?

                        just respond, or /qino-concept:explore board-games
```

Not a dashboard. Not a menu. A place to arrive before you work.

### Building in phases

Iterations aren't sprints. They're checkpoints for turn-taking.

AI implements to the iteration spec. User tests and reviews. Feedback flows before the next phase begins. Each iteration has scope, goals, and test criteria — clear enough to build toward, flexible enough to learn from.

The files live in `implementations/` — visible, version-controlled, yours. Not hidden in `.claude/`. Not abstracted away. You can read them, edit them, understand what's planned.

```bash
/qino-dev:init path/to/concept.md
/qino-dev:app
```

## Ecological Testing

Using `/qino:test` to notice the system's own nature.

### Tests as Guardians

Tests are not metrics. They do not optimize or rank. They are questions posed at the gap between forms.

They do not check the parts (is the code correct? is the concept clear?). They guard the **integrity of the relationships between them**.

When an idea moves from a **concept**, into **code**, and finally into a **user's hands**, it crosses "epistemological gaps"—places where the form changes completely. In these transitions, vitality is often lost. The code works, but the feeling is gone.

Ecological tests stand at these gaps. They ask: _Does the pattern that holds this together still survive in this new form?_

This specificity is how the system sustains itself. By maintaining the distinct character of each local ecology—protecting the **Gesture** from becoming a **Command**, keeping the **World** distinct from the **Logic**—it avoids collapsing into a generic tool. When the local characters hold their shape, the in-between spaces remain alive with relation. If they dissolve into sameness, the ecology stops learning.

_Example: "Gesture" stays distinct from "Command," so the translation between them can teach you something._

**`/qino:test` provides the friction to feel this.** It interrupts the smooth momentum of production to signal when a character is fading, forcing us to notice and restore the integrity before it is lost.

### The Eight Ecologies

Each ecology has its own question because each guards a different kind of integrity. _(These roughly map to the [command namespaces](#command-namespaces) — same pattern, different context.)_

The command discerns which ecology you are speaking from and offers a test to deepen your noticing.

| Ecology            | Focus            | The Question                                                                       |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User**           | Lived experience | Does this make it easier to notice something and respond from curiosity?           |
| **Gesture**        | Movement & touch | Does this feel like a natural human movement, without knowing it is "input"?       |
| **Figure**         | Shape & boundary | Can this be re-entered and still feel like "the same thing" after change?          |
| **Relation**       | Connection       | Does this introduce a tension or ambiguity that neither side resolves alone?       |
| **World**          | Environment      | Does the world surprise without contradicting itself?                              |
| **Echo**           | Resonance        | Does this preserve the gesture while transforming it just enough to be noticeable? |
| **Fabric**         | Pattern          | Does accumulation make echoes more likely without making them necessary?           |
| **Infrastructure** | Foundation       | Does this avoid introducing meaning, authority, or voice of its own?               |

### The Noticing Loop

The test observes. It does not develop. It invites you to pause and see. You can test a specific concept, a feature, a file, or infer the scope from the current conversation context.

```
/qino:test the card stack interaction

(agent) This feels like user ecology, but could also be generic friction.
        Let's try the lived experience test:

        "Does this make it easier for the user to notice something,
         feel a relation forming, and respond from curiosity rather than obligation?"

        Holding that question — what do you notice?

(user)  It feels like obligation. The stack demands sorting. It feels heavy.

(agent) ∴ heavy stack demands sorting

        Capture this, or let it inform without persisting?
```

When you capture, the noticing becomes a note with ecology metadata (`user: heavy stack demands sorting`). This metadata allows `/qino:home` to show you which ecologies are echoing and which have been silent.

## Perceiving Difference

Discovering the difference that makes a difference — `qino:compare` and `qino:attune`.

### Compare: The Parallel Mirror

You have two examples from different sources — different chronicles, different scribe versions, different approaches. Compare helps you find what makes them land differently.

**1 — Surface initial impressions.** Questions like "what stays with you after reading this section?" and "At what point did your attention start to drift?" Each surfaces something. The structure disappears into conversation.

**2 — Find the parallel.** You share what you liked about one example. Based on that, the system finds something in the _other_ source with the same structural shape. It presents both:

```
you liked
  "The river carried news of her before she arrived."
  Observation without comment. World notices wanderer.

parallel from B
  "Seren watched from the doorway, cataloguing."
  Same structure — external observer, no commentary.

─────

How do these land differently?
```

**3 — Discover what the difference reveals.** The parallel _looks_ like it should work the same way — but if it doesn't, that reveals something deeper. Not just a difference between two passages, but a difference between the two sources they came from. The chronicles have different underlying logics. The parallel that "should" work but doesn't is where you discover that.

**4 — Sharpen language through responsive mirroring.** You say "A feels personal, B feels like adventure but no pull." The tool reflects back: "A creates _identification_. B starts as _adventure_ but the engagement doesn't convert into investment." Now you have words to build on.

By the end, you've discovered something you couldn't have named at the start.

### Attune: From Hunch to Craft

You start with a hunch — an aesthetic quality like "otherworldliness" or "tension" or "aliveness." You know it when you feel it, but you can't teach it. This tool came from that kind of exploration. The calibration creates conditions where implicit knowledge can surface.

**1 — Find candidates.** Search your existing work for 8-15 potential examples. Cast a wide net.

**2 — Calibrate through feedback.** Go through each candidate one by one. Does this qualify? What makes it work or not? Distinctions emerge:

```
| ✓ Works                            | ✗ Doesn't work                    |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| External observation, unremarked   | Character explains the phenomenon |
| Pattern across multiple observers  | Single character's perception     |
| Points to *elsewhere*              | Ties to local mystery             |
```

**3 — Build evaluation index.** You now know what _doesn't_ work. The failures point toward what's missing. So you search for language that might address those gaps — literary terms (numinous, sfumato, negative space), character archetypes who embody the quality (what makes Tom Bombadil work?), techniques from other domains (visual art, music, sculpture). Each source gets documented: what it is, why it's relevant, how it might guide execution. The index becomes a toolkit for transformation.

**4 — Transform iteratively.** Take a failed example. Choose a source from the index that seems most likely to address _that specific failure_. Transform. Present for feedback.

When a fix fails, your feedback reveals what you actually want. "Sounds like ignoring, not mystery" — that rejection teaches you something about your own aesthetic. You try a different source, now informed by what you just learned. **The iteration trains your perception — and builds sensitivity to these distinctions into the AI conversation context, so you can crystallize the learnings and teach them.** By the time a transformation works, you understand _why_ it works — not just that it does.

Some examples won't transform. That's data too. Note what makes them intractable.

**5 — Formulate guidance.** The distinctions you discovered — what landed, what didn't, what you kept reaching for — become ways of staying sensitive to the difference.

```
calibrations/otherworldliness/
├── research.md          # what qualifies, distinctions, inspiration index
├── transformations.md   # every attempt, what worked, guidance that emerged
└── examples/            # the corpus tested against
```

What you couldn't explain, you can now teach. What you could only feel, you can now protect.

_(The [Qualities of Attention](#the-ecology-at-work-qualities-of-attention) section is a product of this process — the Wanderer's Lens emerged from an Attune calibration.)_

```bash
/qino:compare path/to/a.md path/to/b.md
/qino:attune quality-name

## qino Research

A space for open-ended research — before ideas become concepts.

### What is this?

Research is where ideas are too fluid for structure to help:

- **Explorations** — Open-ended inquiry without structure pressure.
- **Calibrations** — Refining distinctions and building sensitivity to subtle differences. _(See [Attune](#attune-from-hunch-to-craft).)_
- **Experiments** — Controlled tests with crafted data.
- **Graduation** — Moving insights to concepts-repo when ready.

Unlike concepts (which stabilize over time), research moves fast, welcomes uncertainty, and accepts inconclusive results as valuable data.

### Commands

| Command                                  | Purpose                                                |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/qino:home`                             | See the research landscape (explorations vs concepts). |
| `/qino-research:begin [topic]`           | Start or continue an exploration.                      |
| `/qino-research:experiment [hypothesis]` | Run a controlled test.                                 |
| `/qino-research:graduate [id]`           | Promote to concepts-repo.                              |

### Graduation

When an exploration finds its shape, it graduates to Concepts. The insight stabilizes; the uncertainty doesn't disappear — it just has a home.

## Design Adventure

A design conversation that already happened. You arrive afterward.

### The room after

You launch it, then enter the room after it happened. Chairs still warm. Ideas still in the air. You discover what emerged — the questions they kept circling back to, what they couldn't resolve.

Six perspectives think through words. The seventh (World) thinks through environment — a draft scatters someone's diagrams; they gather them differently and that's when the insight arrives. _(World doesn't speak — it acts. See: [Narrator's Lens](#the-narrators-lens-world-as-participant).)_

### What you find

```
design-sprints/2024-12-15_collaboration-vs-focus/
├── __enter-here.md
├── dialogue.md
├── q-what-signals-legitimate-interruption.md
├── q-can-focus-be-collaborative.md
├── q-who-decides-when-to-break-flow.md
└── synthesis.md
```

From `q-can-focus-be-collaborative.md`:

> **The Skeptic:** We keep saying "focus time" as if it's always solo. But pair programming is focus. Whiteboard sessions can be deep work.
>
> **The Embodied Thinker:** There's a different quality of attention — when you're tracking someone else's rhythm, not just your own.
>
> **The World:** _The fluorescent light hums. Someone's pen taps against the table._
>
> **The Synthesizer:** Maybe the question isn't collaboration vs. focus. It's whose rhythm you're in.

_Notice: World interrupts without words. The hum and tap are pressure._

Different runs surface different questions. The questions themselves teach you how to think about the problem.

```bash
/design-adventure How do we balance real-time collaboration with focus time?
```

## Adapters

This repository uses its own tools. The source files live in `tools/`, and adapter commands in `.claude/commands/` reference them.

```
tools/qino-universal/commands/qino/        → .claude/commands/qino/
tools/qino-concept/commands/qino-concept/  → .claude/commands/qino-concept/
tools/qino-scribe/commands/qino-scribe/    → .claude/commands/qino-scribe/
tools/qino-research/commands/qino-research/→ .claude/commands/qino-research/
```

**qino-claude is both the source of tools and a user of them.**

This is the "adapter" pattern described in The Ecosystem section. The self-use is the point — the tools shape the work that shapes the tools.

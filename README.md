<summary><strong>Companions on the Path: The Pattern That Connects</strong></summary>

### The Young Anthropologists and the Question of Fascism

In 1932, Gregory Bateson met Margaret Mead on the Sepik River in New Guinea. Both were in their late twenties. The world was darkening—Mussolini had been in power for a decade, Hitler was ascending, and the patterns of thought that would consume Europe were already taking hold.

Bateson had been studying the Iatmul people, watching their elaborate rituals of boasting and counter-boasting, dominance and submission. He noticed something troubling: communication could become a runaway process. When one group boasts, the other boasts back louder. When one side dominates, the other submits further, inviting more dominance. He called this *schismogenesis*—the creation of division through escalating feedback. Left unchecked, it tears societies apart.

Then he and Mead went to Bali. There they found something different. The Balinese practiced what Bateson called "stasis"—their interactions didn't spiral. Competition didn't escalate into arms races; submission didn't deepen into abjection. Somehow, their culture had patterns that absorbed perturbation rather than amplifying it.

The question haunting this work: *Could communication be shaped to resist the runaway polarization that feeds totalitarianism?*

This wasn't abstract. By the time they returned to America in 1939, war had begun. They turned their anthropological methods toward understanding fascist propaganda, analyzing Nazi films, studying "national character" at a distance. Mead and Bateson even designed a board game—never published—based on the principle that "Democracies and Dictators play by different rules."

But Bateson grew troubled. Using his theories as propaganda tools—even against fascism—felt like participating in the very escalation he had diagnosed. After the war, he largely withdrew from applied social science, turning instead toward cybernetics, ecology, and the question of how living systems learn.

### The Pattern That Connects

What emerged from this journey was a different way of seeing. Bateson came to understand mind not as something inside brains, but as a pattern distributed through living systems—families, forests, societies, the relationship between organisms and their environments.

He asked: *What is the pattern that connects the crab to the lobster and the orchid to the primrose, and all four of them to me? And me to you?*

And he defined information not as data, but as *a difference which makes a difference*—something relational, something that only exists in the gap between contexts.

These ideas hum through the tools in this repository:
- **Abductive process**: Meaning emerges by casting one context onto another, discovering what was latent
- **Transcontextuality**: Nothing is "just that and nothing more"—every interaction speaks into multiple contexts simultaneously
- **The alive thread**: Following what carries energy, what still wants to move
- **Divergence and convergence**: Living systems need both surprise and coherence; neither alone suffices

### Nora Bateson: The Unseen Coalescence

Nora Bateson, Gregory's daughter, has extended this work into new territory. She asks: if "insidious" describes how pathology creeps up through unseen combining processes—racism, addiction, corruption—what is the word for the opposite? For how vitality, healing, and creativity coalesce in ways we cannot see?

She calls this **aphanipoiesis** (Greek: *aphanis* = unseen, unnoticed + *poiesis* = to bring forth).

> "The change before the change... what coalesces prior to emergence."

This is not hidden—it is merely out of habituated perception. Like the soil beneath a forest, teeming with relational processes while attention is caught by what stands visible above.

Her key insight: *One cannot explicitly change that which is implicit.* Direct correctives fail against insidious patterns because those patterns formed in the unseen stitching between contexts—between family and economy, between education and identity, between language and expectation. To touch that realm requires tending the *about* so that the *within* can shift.

**Warm Data** is her term for the kind of information that can hold this complexity: "transcontextual information about the interrelationships that integrate a complex system." Not cold data extracted from context, but living information that shifts within the mutual learning of systems.

### What This Means Here

The tools here are experiments in aphanipoietic design—they tend explicit structures so implicit patterns can re-wild. They don't try to fix systems by adjusting parts. They create conditions where aliveness can emerge through dialogue, marking, and the right kind of constraints.

The Batesonian patterns are not applied as methodology but absorbed as sensibility:
- Questions reveal what you didn't know you were asking
- The alive thread guides movement more reliably than plans
- What's held quietly can resurface when needed
- The human feels what's alive; the system holds what's set down

This is the inheritance: from young anthropologists watching rituals on the Sepik, troubled by how communication can tear worlds apart—to the ongoing question of how living systems learn to change into something they don't yet know how to become.

<summary><strong>The Chronicles: The Story of an Evolving Ecosystem</strong></summary>

Each repository in the qino ecosystem tells its own story.

**qino-claude** — Claude-based AI tooling.

> *The wanderer pressed her ear to the workshop wall. Sounds on the other side that weren't there yesterday — someone moving, maybe. Something being made ready. She stayed there a long time, listening.*

**concepts-repo** — concept development.

> *A notebook on the table, open to a page the wanderer didn't remember writing. The handwriting was theirs.*

**qinolabs-repo** — web and mobile applications.

> *Something had shifted in the night. Not the furniture — the distances between things.*

Same scribe. Different worlds. Different atmospheric registers. Process in each informs the others — a co-evolution.

> *The Keeper of Paths looked up from her maps. "Someone's been walking between the Workshop and the Warm Room. Over and over. The ground remembers."*
>
> *"What are they looking for?"*
>
> *She smiled. "They'll know when they stop."*

## qino Concept

A gentle space for developing ideas.

### The question it asks

Most tools assume you can get to a meaningful output by filling in the sections — complete the template, check the boxes, and the result will have value.

This tool works through dialogue. It asks what draws you, follows that thread, asks again. Each response surfaces something — a connection you hadn't named, a quality you were circling around, a direction that suddenly feels right. You discover what your idea actually holds by staying with it, turning it gently, going deeper where it rewards attention.

### What it holds

When you bring in a note, not everything makes it into your concept. The rest isn't lost — it's held. Quietly indexed. No guilt about what you didn't carry forward. Later, if you're stuck, the tool might say: *"There's something held in your origins — about [that theme]. Does it still have warmth?"*

It remembers what you set down so you can forget safely.

### Home

A place to check in before you venture out.

You see what's here — movements that happened recently, threads that might be interesting to pull. You're not asked what you want to do. You arrive, orient, then choose to go somewhere. Home receives you before offering paths.

### The mirror

The tool asks a question. You respond. The tool surfaces something back — a reflection, a reframing, a possible direction. And in meeting that response, you discover what you actually think.

Your perceiving is the process. The agent isn't extracting information from you — it's providing a surface where you can meet your own sense of what matters. The dialogue becomes an interface for encountering yourself.

```bash

## qino Scribe

Adventure emerges from pressure. The chronicle is a living world.

### Pressure-first chronicle

Your ecosystem evolves through conversations and work that spans sessions. qino Scribe turns that movement into a fantasy chronicle with action, consequence, and a wanderer who acts — not documentation in costume.

### How it works (six phases)

- **Ground before diff** — read the theme and world, note unexplored places and figures waiting to appear
- **Observe what changed** — read the git range, ask who in-world is disturbed and what could go wrong
- **Discover four options** — Expected, Unexpected Location, Complication, Journey; choose the most alive (action + stakes)
- **Propose → Write** — present the beat, then draft with one explanatory exchange max; the world must act, and the wanderer must risk something
- **Update world.md** — pressures, wanderer, characters, locations, arcs; add journal entries when arcs complete

### Show, don't tell

> *The receiving hall's windows were salted with mist. Selin kept glancing east, counting the beats between lanterns. "Three days late," she said, not to the wanderer but to the empty air. The room seemed to listen back.*

**Pressures** (`world.md`)

```markdown
## Pressures

### The Valley Traders Are Late
Three days without word. Selin keeps glancing east.

### The Third Stack
Whatever Selin hid in the third stack is changing her.
```

**Aftermath** (wanderer section)

```markdown
## The Wanderer

The wanderer took the long way back. A cup sat on the sill that hadn't been there. The forked path looked more worn on the route they didn't take.
```

**World Tokens**

```markdown
**Selin**
Cartographer. Eyes like deep space. Holds her stylus like a conductor's baton.

**The Receiving Hall**
Curved desks, luminous paper, star-chart dust in the air.
```

```bash
/scribe:chapter
```

## Design Adventure

A simulated conversation between seven perspectives — an adventure you witness.

### The room after

You don't participate in the conversation. You launch it, then enter the room after it happened.

Chairs still warm. Ideas still in the air. You discover what emerged — the questions they kept circling back to, the moments that shifted everything, what they couldn't resolve.

You weren't there for the heat of debate. You arrive for the clarity that followed, and a world you can continue to explore.

### The seventh perspective

Six perspectives think through words. The seventh thinks through environment.

A draft cuts through and scatters someone's diagrams. They gather them differently — and that's when the insight arrives. Heat presses in; someone shifts before continuing. The overhead light flickers and when it steadies, something has shifted in the room's geometry.

The World doesn't comment on the conversation. It interrupts, constrains, grounds. It offers friction when abstraction runs too long. It makes metaphors physical when they're ready to become so.

The room participates. And what it offers shapes what can be said next.

### Thinking, not conclusions

You don't see polished recommendations. You see ideas meet resistance, evolve, surprise themselves. The Skeptic says "wait, no, that's too neat." The Explorer flips the question. The Embodied Thinker circles toward something no one can name yet.

Productive disagreement isn't failure. It's how the real tensions surface — the ones you couldn't have named before the conversation revealed them.

### What you don't know until after

You bring a tension you can't resolve. But you don't know what questions actually matter until the conversation reveals them.

Different runs surface different questions. This isn't noise to filter out. It's the system showing you what matters in this moment, for this challenge, given what these perspectives noticed.

The questions themselves teach you how to think about the problem.

```bash
/design-adventure How do we balance real-time collaboration with focus time?
```

## Dev Assistant

Turn an app concept into a development environment with custom commands.

### The bridge

Technical decisions live in one realm. The experience you're building lives in another. Most development loses the bridge between them — you start with a feeling, then spend months in code, and somewhere along the way the feeling fades into requirements.

This tool keeps the bridge alive. The conversation captures not just what you're building but what it should feel like to use. The guide holds that essence. And every command reads from the guide — so when you're deep in implementation, the experience you're walking toward still informs each step.

You don't lose the soul while building the structure.

### The landing

You bring a concept — maybe a few paragraphs, maybe just bullet points. The conversation begins immediately with pattern recognition: what transformation is this creating? What's the emotional architecture underneath the features?

Five chapters unfold: entry experience, core loop, social fabric, evolution patterns, technical philosophy. Each one surfaces something you knew but hadn't articulated, or connects something you hadn't seen connected.

By the end, you have commands that know your project and a guide that holds what matters.

### The conversation builds

The conversation doesn't extract information from you. It builds on what you offer.

"They pick from pixel art film critics."

"Beautiful! This makes me think about how gaming avatars create investment. Your approach unlocks two paths: cosmetic identity versus weighted evaluation. If the Snobby Critic weights nuance higher and the Popcorn Fan values clarity, you get richer aggregate data..."

Your half-formed thought becomes architectural possibility. The conversation shows you what your idea contains.

### Living guide

What emerges isn't documentation you write once and forget. It's a reference the commands read at runtime.

When you run `/yourapp:build`, it reads your current vision and complexity budget. When you run `/yourapp:review`, it checks your work against the principles you established. When your understanding deepens, you update the guide — and the commands deepen with it.

The system stays in sync with your evolving sense of what you're building.

```bash
/core:project-init your-concept.md
```

## qino Eval

Discover what makes creative work work — and improve the system that makes it.

### The felt sense is the data

You read two chapters. One pulls you forward; one doesn't. You can feel the difference before you can name it.

qino Eval provides frameworks that help you articulate what the felt sense is responding to. Seven dimensions for quality. Six dimensions for progression. But the frameworks don't override the feeling — they help you find language for it.

> *"The wanderer becomes textured and multi-dimensional, not because of what they said, but precisely because they didn't have to say it. In that moment, I, the reader, am telling the story. I, the reader, am filling the gaps — and it feels engaging, because there's something of ME in it now."*

That's not analysis. That's someone discovering why a passage worked.

### Compare: which works better, and why

Two chapters side by side. Maybe from different tools, different chronicles, different approaches to the same challenge.

You read both. Notice what stays with you. Find the passages that worked — and the ones that didn't. The framework gives you questions:

| Dimension | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| Action | Does the wanderer do or only witness? |
| Stakes | What could go wrong? |
| Discovery | Told or shown? |
| World | Does environment act or only contain? |

One chapter might build immersive atmosphere but leave you indifferent. Another might feel rougher but create genuine stakes. The comparison reveals what matters:

> *"In A, the wanderer risks being seen by a world that's paying attention. In B, the world is beautifully rendered but indifferent — and indifference is contagious."*

### Progression: does the chronicle move?

Two chapters from the same chronicle. Does the second feel like it *needed* to follow the first?

| Dimension | What it feels like |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Pull | Incompleteness at chapter end — wanting the next |
| Meet | Continuation at chapter start — being acknowledged |
| Weight | Accumulation — later chapters carry earlier ones |
| Echo | Callbacks that land, not just occur |

Progression isn't continuity. It's momentum — the felt sense of being pulled through a story.

### The learning loop

This is where it gets powerful.

```
evaluation → insight → architectural change → next evaluation tests the change
```

You compare chapters. You discover a principle: *"The wanderer gains depth through how others respond to what they don't say."* That's not just feedback on one chapter — it's insight that can change how the scribe works.

The insight flows back:
- Problems that recur become fixes in `process.md`
- Patterns that work become reinforcement in `soul.md`
- Structural issues become changes in `craft.md`

Then you generate again. Evaluate again. See if the change helped.

Over time, the evaluation log accumulates patterns. Problems that keep appearing. Fixes that worked. The scribe improves not through random iteration but through discovered principles.

### Principles discovered

From a single evaluation session comparing two approaches:

**The Mutual Seeing Principle** — The wanderer sees the world; the world must see back. Without mutual gaze, no stakes.

**The Relational Mirror Principle** — Characters gain depth through how others respond to what they *don't* say.

**The Reader as Co-Author Principle** — Beautiful description can render a world the reader admires but never enters. If every meaning is delivered, there's nothing to contribute. The gap must have *pull*.

These principles now live in the scribe's architecture. The next chapter will be different because of what the evaluation discovered.

```bash
/eval:compare chapter-a.md chapter-b.md
/eval:progression chapter-1.md chapter-2.md
```

## Adapters

This repository uses its own tools. The source files live in `tools/`, and adapter commands in `.claude/commands/` reference them.

```
tools/qino-concept/commands/qino/    → .claude/commands/qino/
tools/qino-scribe/commands/scribe/   → .claude/commands/scribe/
tools/qino-eval/commands/eval/       → .claude/commands/eval/
```

Adapters are thin wrappers that import the source command and adjust paths. This lets us develop tools and use them in the same repository without duplication.

---

## Installation

**Quick:** Download `all-tools.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/qinolabs/qino-claude/releases/latest), unzip, copy contents to `.claude/` in your project.

*Each tool here was conceived through its own process. What you build will circle back to refine what built it — larger arcs of smaller circles. For example: we used the tools themselves to improve the descriptions of themselves, which we in turn used as a lens to improve the implementation of the tools.*

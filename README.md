## Qino Concept

A gentle space for developing ideas.

### The question it asks

Most tools assume you can get to a meaningful output by filling in the sections — complete the template, check the boxes, and the result will have value.

This tool works through dialogue. It asks what draws you, follows that thread, asks again. Each response surfaces something — a connection you hadn't named, a quality you were circling around, a direction that suddenly feels right. You discover what your idea actually holds by staying with it, turning it gently, going deeper where it rewards attention.

### What it holds

When you bring in a note, not everything makes it into your concept. The rest isn't lost — it's held. Quietly indexed. No guilt about what you didn't carry forward. Later, if you're stuck, the tool might say: *"There's something held in your origins — about [that theme]. Does it still have warmth?"*

It remembers what you set down so you can forget safely.

### Home

A place to check in before you venture out.

You see what's here — movements that happened recently, threads that might be interesting to pull. You're not asked what you want to do. You arrive, orient, then choose to go somewhere. Home receives you before offering paths.

### The mirror

The tool asks a question. You respond. The tool surfaces something back — a reflection, a reframing, a possible direction. And in meeting that response, you discover what you actually think.

Your perceiving is the process. The agent isn't extracting information from you — it's providing a surface where you can meet your own sense of what matters. The dialogue becomes an interface for encountering yourself.

```bash
/qino:init
/qino:home
/qino:explore concept-name
/qino:add-notes path/to/notes.md
/qino:ecosystem

## Qino Scribe

The ecosystem tells its own story.

### Fantasy world

Your ecosystem evolves through conversations and accumulated notes. Changes happen across sessions. Threads emerge.

Qino Scribe transforms this into a fantasy world. Not metaphor — an actual place you can return to. Characters appear when concepts arrive. Locations reveal hidden rooms when ideas deepen. Seasons shift when larger patterns surface.

> *The wanderer stood at the edge of Discovery-Grid. Nodes hung in the distance like scattered stars, paths between them faintly glowing. Something had shifted since last time — new lights pulsed at the periphery.*

The chronicle is something you could give to a collaborator, revisit in a year, or read like a children's book by nightlamp.

### Walkable abstraction

A concept becomes a location. An ecosystem pattern becomes weather. A held thread becomes a door glimpsed through fog.

When a new concept arrives, a traveler might appear at the threshold — someone who wasn't there before, carrying questions no one else has asked yet.

When a concept deepens, the location reveals what was always there but hidden:

> *The Weaving-Room was warm, as always. But today there was a door the wanderer hadn't noticed — or perhaps it had just become. Behind it, threads hung in patterns that moved without wind.*

When a connection emerges between ideas, a path appears:

> *The path appeared where no path had been — a narrow track of beaten light connecting Discovery-Grid to something beyond the mist. The wanderer hadn't made it. It had simply become.*

When something is held but not yet ready, it waits:

> *In the distance, past the new path, something moved. Too far to see clearly. The wanderer noted it, stored it somewhere below thought, and turned back toward the known.*

Ideas at different levels — specific features, whole concepts, ecosystem-wide patterns — all become places you can walk between.

### The world accumulates

Each chapter builds on what came before. Characters have first appearances and last-seen notes. Locations have atmosphere and history. Arcs track tensions across chapters, not tasks within them.

> *"You've been circling this place," said a figure at the threshold — the one who always waited there, though no one knew for how long. "What are you looking for?"*
>
> *The wanderer didn't answer immediately. The question felt larger than it sounded.*

By chapter ten, you feel you know this place. The world has grown with your thinking.

### The wanderer

The wanderer is the protagonist — but not the narrator. They participate in the story, appear in third person, learn rather than lead. They make mistakes. They're accompanied by figures who emerge from the world.

> *The path appeared where no path had been — a narrow track of beaten light. The wanderer hadn't made it. It had simply become.*

The wanderer is your presence in the world. But the world doesn't revolve around them. They're a traveler, discovering alongside you what the ecosystem has become.

```bash
/scribe:chapter
```

## Design Adventure

A simulated conversation between seven perspectives — an adventure you witness.

### The room after

You don't participate in the conversation. You launch it, then enter the room after it happened.

Chairs still warm. Ideas still in the air. You discover what emerged — the questions they kept circling back to, the moments that shifted everything, what they couldn't resolve.

You weren't there for the heat of debate. You arrive for the clarity that followed, and a world you can continue to explore.

### The seventh perspective

Six perspectives think through words. The seventh thinks through environment.

A draft cuts through and scatters someone's diagrams. They gather them differently — and that's when the insight arrives. Heat presses in; someone shifts before continuing. The overhead light flickers and when it steadies, something has shifted in the room's geometry.

The World doesn't comment on the conversation. It interrupts, constrains, grounds. It offers friction when abstraction runs too long. It makes metaphors physical when they're ready to become so.

The room participates. And what it offers shapes what can be said next.

### Thinking, not conclusions

You don't see polished recommendations. You see ideas meet resistance, evolve, surprise themselves. The Skeptic says "wait, no, that's too neat." The Explorer flips the question. The Embodied Thinker circles toward something no one can name yet.

Productive disagreement isn't failure. It's how the real tensions surface — the ones you couldn't have named before the conversation revealed them.

### What you don't know until after

You bring a tension you can't resolve. But you don't know what questions actually matter until the conversation reveals them.

Different runs surface different questions. This isn't noise to filter out. It's the system showing you what matters in this moment, for this challenge, given what these perspectives noticed.

The questions themselves teach you how to think about the problem.

```bash
/design-adventure How do we balance real-time collaboration with focus time?
```

## Dev Assistant

Turn an app concept into a development environment with custom commands.

### The bridge

Technical decisions live in one realm. The experience you're building lives in another. Most development loses the bridge between them — you start with a feeling, then spend months in code, and somewhere along the way the feeling fades into requirements.

This tool keeps the bridge alive. The conversation captures not just what you're building but what it should feel like to use. The guide holds that essence. And every command reads from the guide — so when you're deep in implementation, the experience you're walking toward still informs each step.

You don't lose the soul while building the structure.

### The landing

You bring a concept — maybe a few paragraphs, maybe just bullet points. The conversation begins immediately with pattern recognition: what transformation is this creating? What's the emotional architecture underneath the features?

Five chapters unfold: entry experience, core loop, social fabric, evolution patterns, technical philosophy. Each one surfaces something you knew but hadn't articulated, or connects something you hadn't seen connected.

By the end, you have commands that know your project and a guide that holds what matters.

### The conversation builds

The conversation doesn't extract information from you. It builds on what you offer.

"They pick from pixel art film critics."

"Beautiful! This makes me think about how gaming avatars create investment. Your approach unlocks two paths: cosmetic identity versus weighted evaluation. If the Snobby Critic weights nuance higher and the Popcorn Fan values clarity, you get richer aggregate data..."

Your half-formed thought becomes architectural possibility. The conversation shows you what your idea contains.

### Living guide

What emerges isn't documentation you write once and forget. It's a reference the commands read at runtime.

When you run `/yourapp:build`, it reads your current vision and complexity budget. When you run `/yourapp:review`, it checks your work against the principles you established. When your understanding deepens, you update the guide — and the commands deepen with it.

The system stays in sync with your evolving sense of what you're building.

```bash
/core:project-init your-concept.md
```

# qino-claude

A Story-Driven Development environment that keeps developers connected to the user experience they're creating.

## Story-Driven Development

This environment uses Story-Driven Development to maintain connection between technical implementation and user experience.

## Getting Started

### First Time Setup
```bash
# 1. Initialize your project with Genesis
claude
/core:project-genesis your-concept.md

# 2. Complete the 40-minute onboarding journey
# Claude will guide you through an immersive exploration

# 3. Your first command will be provided at the end
/[your-project]:[first-moment]
```

### Daily Development Flow
```bash
# Start your session
/[project]:morning-ritual
# Reviews vision, suggests focus for today

# Implement features through story
/[project]:[moment-name]
# Each command reminds you why you're building

# Check alignment
/[project]:vision-check
# Ensures you're still serving the core experience
```

## Understanding Story-Driven Commands

Commands in this system aren't just functions - they're moments in your user's journey:

- `/project:dawn` - Not just "startup", but the beginning of something
- `/project:revelation` - Not just "display result", but a moment of discovery
- `/project:connection` - Not just "add friend", but forming a bond

Each command:
1. Describes the user moment
2. Defines the feeling goal
3. Provides implementation guidance
4. Protects the vision

## Project Structure

After Genesis, your project will have:

```
.claude/
├── world-bible/          # Your product's living documentation
│   ├── concept-core.md   # The heart of your vision
│   ├── experience-map.md # User journey as narrative
│   ├── command-stories.md # Every command's purpose
│   └── evolution-log.md  # How vision grows
├── commands/
│   └── [project]/        # Your story-driven commands
└── templates/            # For extending the system
```

## Philosophy

We build better when we remember we're creating experiences, not just features. This system ensures every line of code connects to the human moment it serves.

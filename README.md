[![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/qinolabs/qino-claude?label=download)](https://github.com/qinolabs/qino-claude/releases/latest)

Tools for working with ideas in [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code).

This work reflects a way of thinking that found its seed in Gregory and Nora Bateson's work. The tools don't explain their ideas—they _practice_ them.

They help us notice what connects, learn without extracting, and participate in an ecology co-evolving through our attention.

### The Young Anthropologists and the Question of Fascism

In 1932, Gregory Bateson met Margaret Mead on the Sepik River in New Guinea. Both were in their late twenties. The world was darkening—Mussolini had been in power for a decade, Hitler was ascending, and the patterns of thought that would consume Europe were already taking hold.

Bateson had been studying the Iatmul people, watching their elaborate rituals of boasting and counter-boasting, dominance and submission. He noticed something troubling: communication could become a runaway process. When one group boasts, the other boasts back louder. When one side dominates, the other submits further, inviting more dominance. He called this _schismogenesis_—the creation of division through escalating feedback. Left unchecked, it tears societies apart.

Then he and Mead went to Bali. There they found something different. The Balinese practiced what Bateson called "stasis"—their interactions didn't spiral. Competition didn't escalate into arms races; submission didn't deepen into abjection. Somehow, their culture had patterns that absorbed perturbation rather than amplifying it.

The question haunting this work: _Could communication be shaped to resist the runaway polarization that feeds totalitarianism?_

This wasn't abstract. By the time they returned to America in 1939, war had begun. They turned their anthropological methods toward understanding fascist propaganda, analyzing Nazi films, studying "national character" at a distance. Mead and Bateson even designed a board game—never published—based on the principle that "Democracies and Dictators play by different rules."

But Bateson grew troubled. Using his theories as propaganda tools—even against fascism—felt like participating in the very escalation he had diagnosed. After the war, he largely withdrew from applied social science, turning instead toward cybernetics, ecology, and the question of how living systems learn.

### The Pattern That Connects

What emerged from this journey was a different way of seeing. Bateson came to understand mind not as something inside brains, but as a pattern distributed through living systems—families, forests, societies, the relationship between organisms and their environments.

He asked: _What is the pattern that connects the crab to the lobster and the orchid to the primrose, and all four of them to me? And me to you?_

And he defined information not as data, but as _a difference which makes a difference_—something relational, something that only exists in the gap between contexts.

### Nora Bateson: The Unseen Coalescence

![Nora Bateson](docs/images/nora-bateson.jpg)

Nora Bateson, Gregory's daughter, has extended this work into new territory. She asks: if "insidious" describes how pathology creeps up through unseen combining processes—racism, addiction, corruption—what is the word for the opposite? For how vitality, healing, and creativity coalesce in ways we cannot see?

She calls this **aphanipoiesis** (Greek: _aphanis_ = unseen, unnoticed + _poiesis_ = to bring forth).

> "The change before the change... what coalesces prior to emergence."

This is not hidden—it is merely out of habituated perception. Like the soil beneath a forest, teeming with relational processes while attention is caught by what stands visible above.

Her key insight: _One cannot explicitly change that which is implicit._ Direct correctives fail against insidious patterns because those patterns formed in the unseen stitching between contexts—between family and economy, between education and identity, between language and expectation. To touch that realm requires tending the _about_ so that the _within_ can shift.

**Warm Data** is her term for the kind of information that can hold this complexity: "transcontextual information about the interrelationships that integrate a complex system." Not cold data extracted from context, but living information that shifts within the mutual learning of systems.

<summary><strong>More on How the Tools Practice the Philosophy</strong><br>(click to expand)</summary>

It's not just that the philosophy fits the code. It's that the code started demanding the philosophy.

As these tools evolved, they stopped being just utilities for "managing knowledge" and became ways of **participating in a system that is learning**. The "User" isn't an operator; they are part of the ecology.

The rhymes have deepened into structural necessities:

- **Abduction**: The logic of the system isn't deduction (proving true/false), but abduction (finding the pattern that connects). Compare and attune don't give you answers; they place two contexts side-by-side so meaning can emerge from the double description.
- **Transcontextuality**: An idea does not follow a straight line. It meanders—from a sudden hunch while coding, to a note in research, to a concept that stabilizes weeks later. The system doesn't force a pipeline; it preserves the living thread across contexts, so you can follow the meaning wherever it leads.
- **Aphanipoiesis (Unseen Coalescence)**: Scribe and capture assume that the most important changes happen _before_ they are explicit. They allow understanding to accumulate in the margins until it's ready to be named.
- **Warm Data**: We don't extract "facts" from our work; we keep the context attached. The system doesn't show you a to-do list; it shows you **what has pull**, what is connected, and what is waiting.

This ecosystem is an attempt to build software that knows it is part of a larger mind—yours, the project's, and the connections between them. It doesn't try to organize your thinking; it tries to learn how to move with it.

</details>

<br>

∴ _Creativity, learning and integration doesn't stop at the boundary of a single repository._

These tools are part of a larger **ecosystem**—a living network of **tools, concepts, apps, research and chronicles** that evolve together. Each offers a way to learn from anything and contribute to your ecology of ideas in the moment spontaneous insight occurs.

∴ _Return your attention to what inspires you right now. Let the system take care of the rest. Things naturally surface when they're ready._

<summary><strong>An Ecology of Mind: The Ecosystem Map</strong><br>(click to expand)</summary>

![Tools, apps, community](docs/images/ecosystem-arcs.png)

Ecological design patterns are alive at every level — in each concept, in each repository, in the ecosystem itself. The art is in the design — affordances and cues, sensitive to experience, that naturally protect the integrity of local ecologies while encouraging free movement without accumulating friction.

What does accumulate are learnings and notes, either woven into existing concepts, or safely kept, ready to reveal itself fully through the next idea that connects. The best ideas can come from anywhere — not centralized — and often while deeply immersed in a different context.

### Figures: The Pattern of Return

_Figure_ in qino is a metaphor — in Bateson's sense, not the literary sense. A persistent form that carries meaning through return.

What forms do figures take?

- **In the apps:** A snapshot you capture when your friend laughs in a certain way. A game design idea saved during a creative meet.
- **In the chronicles:** Characters like Seren and Lira who perceive the wanderer.
- **In concepts:** The recurring patterns that connect one idea to another.

Same pattern, completely different shape in each context. You don't deduce your way to this recognition — you're deep in the scribe, refining how Seren sees the wanderer, and suddenly you recognize something about how figures should work across the apps. The crab teaches you about the lobster. One context illuminates another through pattern, not logic.

_(See also: [Figure Ecology](#ecological-testing) — how we test that a figure can be re-entered and still feel like "the same thing" after change.)_

The tools are also the process for developing the apps — and in turn, the tools and apps keep informing each other. A co-evolution. They share design patterns: affordances that guide without forcing, structures that adapt to context while staying recognizable.

> _"From wherever you approach the system, every experience contains all the others. Communication comes effortlessly. The membrane grows thin — without dissolving into sameness."_

### The Spaces

An early hunch needs room to wander — structure would crush it. A maturing concept needs stability — too much flux and it never settles. An implementation needs grounding — a vision to build toward without getting lost in features.

Each space has its own `chronicle/` directory. Git changes in any repo become chapters — all chronicles are published together on **[qino-chronicles](https://chronicles.qinolabs.com/)**.

**Research** — before concepts crystallize. Inquiries follow threads, qualities refine aesthetics, arcs capture emergence. Welcomes uncertainty.

**Concepts** — where ideas stabilize. The held threads, the notes that weave between them. What arrives here has found its shape.

**Implementation** — where concepts meet code. Structure varies by project domain. Links back to its concept.

**qino-claude** — the source of all tools, distributed through the Claude plugin marketplace.

#### Flow Between Spaces

**Routed flows** — content automatically goes to the right place based on `qino-config.json`:

```
RESEARCH ──capture───▶ CONCEPTS        capture routes insights as notes
RESEARCH ──arc───────▶ RESEARCH        arc captures emergence in arcs/

CONCEPTS ──create────▶ IMPLEMENTATION  implement creates linked project from concept

IMPLEMENTATION ──capture──▶ CONCEPTS   capture routes observations to conceptsRepo
```

**Initiated flows** — you notice something and start:

```
CONCEPTS ────────────▶ RESEARCH        attune creates quality refinement in research
ANYWHERE ────────────▶ RESEARCH        arc captures emergence patterns
```

### The Router

A small file called `qino-config.json` tells each tool which space it's in and where to send things:

```json
{
  "repoType": "research",
  "conceptsRepo": "../concepts-repo",
  "description": "Research space"
}
```

The tools read this configuration and adjust their behavior. A capture in a research repo might become a fragment feeding an inquiry. The same action in an implementation repo sends a note to concepts. The tools stay the same; the context shapes what they do.

### Context Sensitivity

The same words adapt to where you are:

| Action | In concepts | In research | In implementation |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| "where am I" | concepts, notes, threads | inquiries, qualities, arcs | linked concept, stack |
| "capture" | saves to notes/ | saves to fragments/ | saves to linked concepts-repo |
| "test" | tests concept | tests inquiry | tests linked concept |

## Concept

Where ideas come before code. Giving shape to what has pull — exploring possibilities before committing to implementation.

_From concept's view: Ideas sometimes arrive from [Research](#research) — an inquiry that crystallized enough to become something to build. When a concept is ready, [Implementation](#implementation) carries it forward. And [Story](#story) shows what becomes of it in the world._

### qino | Giving Shape to What Has Pull

A gentle space for giving shape to what already has pull.

#### Discovery through dialogue

Most tools assume you can get to a valuable output by filling in the sections — complete the template, check the boxes, and the result will follow. Templates assume structure produces resonance.

This assumes resonance guides structure. It asks what draws you, follows that thread, asks again. Each response surfaces something — a connection you hadn't named, a quality you were circling around, a direction that suddenly feels right. You discover what your idea actually holds by staying with it, turning it gently, going deeper where it rewards attention.

#### Nothing gets lost

When you bring in a note, not everything makes it into your concept. The rest isn't lost — it's held. Each thought is captured as a note with its relevant context preserved, quietly indexed, ready to surface when it matters. No guilt about what you didn't carry forward. Later, if you're stuck, the tool might say: _"There's something held in your origins — about [that theme]. Should we bring it in?"_

It remembers what you set down so you can forget safely. _(This is capture in action — ideas appearing from the held archive.)_

#### Explore

You turn toward a concept to develop it. qino helps you follow what carries energy — the _alive thread_.

```
(you)   explore qino-scribe

(qino)  qino-scribe
        grounding in story, writing tools, git-as-chronicle

        Last touch: 2 days ago
        Active thread: "the membrane between the wanderer and the reader"

        There is also a new note from yesterday:
        "git-weather-pattern" (captured from research)

        What part of this feels alive right now?

(you)   the way code churn feels like weather. a big refactor should feel like a storm.

(qino)  That's a strong impulse — code changes aren't just metadata, they are "Disturbance."

        If we follow that... does this belong in "Ecosystem Integration"?
        Or is this a "new Glowing Connection"?

(you)   it's a glowing connection. the git diff becomes world behavior.

(qino)  Adding that to Glowing Connections.

        "The git diff becomes world behavior. Code churn translates into storms,
         stuck doors, or sudden clearings."

        Does that change how we read the repository?
```

#### Import and capture

- **import** brings outside notes into the manifest. What you don't carry into a concept gets held; home surfaces those held threads later.
- **explore** turns toward one concept (or two at once) and follows the alive thread. Imported notes and captures appear as starting points.
- **capture** saves thoughts immediately to the active context.

### Design Adventure | The Room After

A design conversation that already happened. You arrive afterward.

#### The room after

You launch it, then enter the room after it happened. Chairs still warm. Ideas still in the air. You discover what emerged — the questions they kept circling back to, what they couldn't resolve.

Six perspectives think through words. The seventh (World) thinks through environment — a draft scatters someone's diagrams; they gather them differently and that's when the insight arrives. _(World doesn't speak — it acts. See: [Narrator Lens](#qino-lens--ways-of-seeing).)_

#### What you find

```
design-sprints/2024-12-15_collaboration-vs-focus/
├── __enter-here.md
├── dialogue.md
├── q-what-signals-legitimate-interruption.md
├── q-can-focus-be-collaborative.md
├── q-who-decides-when-to-break-flow.md
└── synthesis.md
```

From `q-can-focus-be-collaborative.md`:

> **The Skeptic:** We keep saying "focus time" as if it's always solo. But pair programming is focus. Whiteboard sessions can be deep work.
>
> **The Embodied Thinker:** There's a different quality of attention — when you're tracking someone else's rhythm, not just your own.
>
> **The World:** _The fluorescent light hums. Someone's pen taps against the table._
>
> **The Synthesizer:** Maybe the question isn't collaboration vs. focus. It's whose rhythm you're in.

_Notice: World interrupts without words. The hum and tap are pressure._

Different runs surface different questions. The questions themselves teach you how to think about the problem.

## Story

Bridges that create story out of raw material. Scribe transforms git into fantasy chronicle; Relay voices research for newcomers; Lens provides the perceptual frameworks both draw from. Art generates visual content with a unified aesthetic.

_These capabilities are consolidated in the `qino-prose` plugin (Scribe, Relay, Lens) and `qino-art` plugin (visual content)._

_From story's view: [Implementation](#implementation) generates the commits that Scribe transforms. [Research](#research) provides the arcs that Relay transmits. Both draw perceptual frameworks from Lens — and [Concept](#concept) work shapes the world that gives the story its ground._

### qino Scribe | Git Becomes Story

qino Scribe keeps the chronicle alive. It reads the git range, grounds in `world.md`, then writes a chapter where the wanderer acts and the world pushes back. The constraints are there to protect story craft: pressure before plot, world that sees the wanderer, action that costs something.

In this repository's chronicle, the wanderer is ferrying a warming pouch upriver. Villages know about them before they arrive. Lira at Orith's Landing recognizes the pouch from years ago; Seren fears the writing filling his margins; the river itself carries news. The chronicle only moves when the wanderer does — and when the world answers.

#### A Chronicle That Accumulates

Your ecosystem evolves through conversations and work that spans sessions. qino Scribe turns that movement into a fantasy chronicle that **gathers weight**. It doesn't just append new chapters; it remembers what has been seen, what remains unspoken, and how the world has been watching.

#### Three-Agent Architecture

Chapters emerge through staged handoffs between specialized agents:

**Prep Agent** — Reads the world state, git changes, and recent chapters. Through three interactive checkpoints (scene seeds → world behavior → story lens), it builds `prep.md`: a constraint document that captures what to write and how to perceive, without carrying the full context forward.

**Prose Agent** — Receives *only* `prep.md` and `world-seed.md`. This hard cut forces fresh invention — no recycled descriptions, no context to lean on. The constraint breeds originality.

**Editorial Agent** — Sees *only* the draft chapter, not the prep that shaped it. Evaluates execution against craft patterns. Returns specific line-level feedback or approval.

The architecture protects what matters: prep shapes without dictating, prose invents within constraints, editorial evaluates blind to intention. Each agent does one thing well.

#### Theme as Seed

The theme establishes the generative grammar — the key signature, atmosphere's origin. But the chronicle grows beyond it. New locations emerge, characters surface, mysteries compound.

Continuity lives in `world.md` and `arcs.md`. The theme is where it started; the chronicle is where it's going.

#### The World's Disturbance

The Disturbance Layer is more than just the world responding to changes in the source material. It is a space that creates a special relationship between the reader and the wanderer.

When you act, the world reacts. A bug isn't just a failure; it's a gate rusted shut. A lost gap isn't just an error; it's a map torn away by a whiteout wind. This responsiveness establishes the **contextual density** of the chronicle, but the core of the layer is relational.

#### The Wanderer's Presence

The wanderer carries a depth no single world can hold. They are not oblivious to the world beyond (your source material), but they do not voice it. This silence creates a bond of recognition and trust.

They are defined not by power, but by **exposure**. They can be hurt, confused, or wrong.

> **The Injury** > _Performance:_ The knife slipped. The wanderer watched the blood, marveling at the vivid red of life.
> _Presence:_ The knife slipped. The cold had stolen the feeling from their fingers, so they only felt the warmth of the blood first. It hit the snow in bright, steaming drops. The wanderer dropped the wood and pressed their palm into the drift, counting the seconds until the numbness returned.

A higher-order presence shines through in **how** they respond to this exposure. This is not a performance of "grace" or "wisdom," but **embodied presence**. They meet friction by staying fully present with the obstacle—not retreating into memory or abstraction.

> **The Gate** > _Performance:_ The wanderer bowed to the locked gate, honoring its resistance.
> _Presence:_ The wind screamed through the iron. The lock was a solid lump of oxidation. The wanderer didn't rattle it. They let their hand drop, the cold lingering on their glove, and turned their back to the wind.

They do not fight the world, but they also do not detach from it. They simply inhabit the moment with full attention.

> **The Map** > _Presence:_ The wind tore the map from their hands. It was gone before they could take a step. The wanderer didn't waste heat shouting. They turned their collar up and kept walking.

#### Mutual Revealing

The central principle of the chronicle is **mutual revealing**: through the implicit response of one entity to the action (or inaction) of another, something is revealed about each.

This applies to everything in the world, not just the wanderer. When a merchant refuses a coin, the refusal reveals the coin's worth _and_ the merchant's fear. When the fog swallows a sound, it reveals the fog's density _and_ the sound's fragility. Meaning emerges from the friction between things.

#### Story Lenses

Each chapter is written through a story lens — a perceptual mode that shapes what the prose agent notices. The lens determines which sensitivities to foreground: what to attend to, what to let recede.

| Lens | The Question |
|------|--------------|
| **Arrival** | What if this chapter is about being received? |
| **Journey** | What if this chapter leaves known ground? |
| **Return** | What if we come back to where we've been? |
| **Discovery** | What if something hidden comes to light? |
| **Confrontation** | What if something must be faced? |
| **Crisis** | What if the pressure breaks now? |
| **Loss** | What if something or someone departs? |
| **Vigil** | What if action is impossible and presence is all? |
| **Ritual** | What if a cultural form holds the chapter? |
| **Complication** | What if the change creates a problem? |
| **Work** | What if this chapter is about making together? |
| **Gathering** | What if multiple threads convene? |

Each lens foregrounds specific sensitivities from [qino Lens](#qino-lens--ways-of-seeing). The Arrival lens foregrounds Newcomer's Eyes — everything noticed, nothing normalized. The Journey lens foregrounds Companion's Lens — world filtered through who you travel with.

At the directions checkpoint, the prep agent presents three lenses that fit the current moment. You choose which perceptual mode shapes the chapter.

#### Complete Transformation

The chronicle must work for a reader who has never heard of the source material. Technical names never leak into the prose. `AuthService` becomes "the gatekeeper's ledger." A database migration becomes "preservation efforts in the archives." The story guards its own reality.

#### How chapters take shape

At each layer, the scribe presents options. You choose — or combine, adjust, ask for more. Options are vocabulary; even rejected ones help articulate what's wanted.

```
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  theme       brown water, green distance, rope bridges swaying

### qino Relay | Bridging to Readers

Sharing research with readers who weren't there.

#### Two bridges, different crossings

Scribe and Relay solve the same problem differently: making internal work accessible to readers who weren't there.

| | Scribe | Relay |
|---|--------|-------|
| **Source** | Git commits | Research arcs |
| **Voice** | The wanderer in a fictional world | The Student as reader companion |
| **Transformation** | Complete — code becomes weather, bugs become stuck gates | Partial — arc structure stays visible, material gets grounded |
| **Reader experience** | Story that stands alone | Learning alongside someone who knows the way |
| **Prep layer** | Yes (commits → story material) | Reader journey notes |
| **Figure's memory** | None across chapters | Learns across transmissions |

Scribe transforms completely. A reader never sees `AuthService` — they see "the gatekeeper's ledger." The chronicle guards its own reality.

Relay preserves structure. The arc's chain remains recognizable — dates, connections, what emerged. But the Student walks alongside a reader encountering it, asking their questions, making abstract concrete.

Both draw from [qino Lens](#qino-lens--ways-of-seeing) for perceptual framing — Scribe through story lenses that shape chapter attention, Relay through the Student's quality of reader companionship.

#### The Student

The transcontextual figure — as the wanderer moves through chronicles, the Student moves through research.

**Reader companionship.** The Student has learned this material and walks alongside readers as they encounter it. They remember what it was like not to know, and voice that remembered uncertainty for the reader.

| The Wanderer | The Student |
|---|---|
| Knows more than they say | Remembers what it was like not to know |
| Creates gap through silence | Creates bridge through questions |
| Reader recognizes what's unsaid | Reader feels accompanied |
| Larger than any single world | Smaller than any single inquiry |
| No memory across chapters | Learns across transmissions |

**What the Student does:**
- Walks alongside the reader, not ahead
- Asks the questions readers would genuinely ask
- Makes abstract concrete without dumbing down
- Voices difficulty, doesn't edit it out

**What the Student is not:**
- Not a lecturer explaining from above
- Not a reporter summarizing findings
- Not a discoverer pretending to find things for the first time
- Not performing uncertainty — mirroring what readers would feel

#### The Student's Memory

Unlike the wanderer (eternal, outside time), the Student **learns** across transmissions. Their memory lives in `journal/student.md`:

- **Reflections** — what the Student notices about their own learning
- **What Has Been Transmitted** — vocabulary readers now share
- **Connections Noticed** — cross-transmission insights
- **Questions Held** — uncertainties carried forward

Each transmission ends with a light coda — "Where I Am Now" — showing questions still held, connections starting to form, what the Student is noticing about the process itself.

#### Reader Journey Notes

Before transmitting, consider what a reader approaching this material would experience. These notes help the prose agent voice the reader's journey authentically:

- **What readers won't already know** — ecosystem specifics, prior arcs, why patterns matter
- **What they might struggle with** — abstractions needing examples, non-obvious connections
- **Questions they would ask** — "How does X actually work?" "What does this look like in practice?"
- **Where concreteness is needed** — abstract patterns, philosophical claims needing illustration

The goal: readers feel accompanied, not lectured. Someone is at their side.

#### The Student's Environment

The transmission opens with the Student somewhere — and moments weave through as they think.

**Interruption Frame** — The opening: place, activity, device announcing. Not generic "café" but specific places with atmosphere:

> _The library was quiet. Morning light through tall windows, mate cooling on the table. Halfway through transcribing yesterday's field notes when—_

**Environmental Texture** — Moments in the body: standing up, walking to window, Elena appearing, rain starting. The prose agent chooses which serve the material.

Places accumulate across transmissions. By transmission 10, readers know this world — the usual corner by the tall windows, the third-floor café with the cracked tile floor, the rooftop where afternoon sun gets too hot.

#### Source Moments

Specific passages from arc material that have their own voice. Not summaries — fragments the Student can encounter directly:

- **Original phrasing** — turns of words from the arc that have weight
- **Questions the arc poses** — implicit questions the Student can voice
- **Concrete moments** — specific examples embedded in the research

The Student encounters these: "'Meaning-*searching* versus meaning-*finding*.' There's something in that hyphen..."

#### Architecture

```
1. Arc selection — which arc(s) to transmit
2. Gather context — arc files + student.md + recent transmissions
3. Reader journey prep — what readers won't know, will struggle with, would ask
4. Prose agent — writes in Student's voice (sees everything + reader journey notes)
5. Editorial agent — reviews voice integrity and reader-companionship
6. Post-prose — update student.md, concepts.md, manifest
```

No prep layer in the Scribe sense. The arc IS the content — it just needs to be voiced *for the reader*.

### qino Lens | Ways of Seeing

Style resists decoration. It is not paint applied to surface; it is a **quality of attention**. A shift in _what is noticed_.

qino-lens pushed its way out of the work. Scribe needed to see the world differently—to perceive friction where there was only plot, to sense agency where there was only setting. I didn't design a library; I extracted the ways of seeing that the chronicle demanded.

The logic of "Attunement"—how perception shifts, how noise is filtered—is the spine of the future ecosystem apps. By working it out here, in text, the lens library tests the technology's weight before it ever becomes application code.

_(Note: I used the narrator lens that emerged from this process to refine this very section — the tool shaping the documentation that explains the tool.)_

The chronicle changes depending on who watches it. These lenses accumulate — discovered through the work, not designed in advance:

#### `narrator` — World as Participant

- **Sensitivity:** Physics, Agency, Structural Agency.
- **The World Acts:** The fog doesn't just hang; it _withholds_. The room doesn't just contain; it _shapes_.
- **The Construction:** This lens ensures the world is solid enough to push back.

> _Example:_ "The corridor didn't just lead to the chamber; it constricted. The ceiling dropped low, forcing a bow, while the walls leaned in to strip away any thought of turning back. The architecture demanded submission before arrival."

_([Reference](tools/qino-prose/references/qino-lens/narrator.md))_

#### `wanderer` — Sensitivity to Friction

- **Sensitivity:** Exposure, Consequence, Absence of Abstraction.
- **The Body Knows:** It notices not the beauty of the ice, but the _numbness_ in the fingers. Not the meaning of silence, but its _weight_.
- **The Inhabitation:** This lens grounds high fantasy in immediate physical cost.

> _Example:_ "The fog pressed against the river, a heavy, wet burden. The ferry wasn't coming. The wanderer unbuckled the strap and slid the pack down the piling, guiding it until it touched the wet wood. They straightened. The sudden lightness made them sway, their shoulders rising into the damp space where the straps had been."

_([Reference](tools/qino-prose/references/qino-lens/wanderer.md))_

#### `newcomer` — Finding What's Become Invisible

- **Sensitivity:** What inhabitants have stopped seeing.
- **The Question:** What would someone notice on their first day here that locals walk past without a glance?
- **The Craft:** The dwelling is the noticing. Don't explain that others don't see — let the prose linger. The reader feels the strangeness through the attention given to it.

> _Example:_ "The oldest woman at the table was served last. Plates circled toward younger faces. She waited, hands folded. When her plate came, she lifted her fork. Then the others began to eat."

_([Reference](tools/qino-prose/references/qino-lens/newcomer.md))_

#### `companion` — World Through Relationship

- **Sensitivity:** How companionship shapes perception.
- **What Changes:** Attention splits between world and person. Things get pointed out. Things get avoided. Silence gains texture. Pace synchronizes — or doesn't.
- **The Craft:** Show relationship through action, not description. Don't label emotional shifts — embody them in what characters do.

> _Example:_ "Varo stopped at a stall. Copper bowls, dented. She picked one up, ran her thumb across a dent. 'My mother had one like this.' Set it back. Moved on. The wanderer lifted the same bowl, found the dent, felt where her thumb had been."

### qino Art | Visual Content System

A complete visual content system with a distinctive aesthetic: **Tron-meets-Excalidraw** — dark slate backgrounds, neon accents (orange warmth, cyan tech), hand-drawn sketch lines, subtle glows.

#### Workflow routing

The art skill routes to specialized workflows based on what you need:

| Need | Workflow |
|------|----------|
| Unsure which approach | Visualize (analyzes & orchestrates) |
| Flowcharts, sequences | Mermaid |
| Abstract metaphor | Editorial illustration |
| System architecture | Technical diagram |
| Categories in grid | Taxonomy |
| Change over time | Timeline |
| 2x2 matrix | Framework |
| Side-by-side contrast | Comparison |
| Screenshot markup | Annotated screenshot |
| Step-by-step process | Recipe card |
| Quote as visual | Aphorism |
| Idea territories | Conceptual map |
| Single striking number | Stat card |
| Multi-panel story | Comic |

Just describe what you want to visualize. The skill determines the appropriate workflow and generates images using the unified aesthetic.

## Implementation

From concept to working code. When exploration has found its shape, implementation carries it forward.

_From implementation's view: [Concept](#concept) is the guiding force — what to build and why. The commits generated here become [Story](#story) material through Scribe. [Research](#research) findings sometimes inform technical decisions._

### Building from Concepts

Implementation companion for concept work.

#### What gets lost in building

You start with a vision. Then the practical demands come — the requirements, the task lists, the "just ship it" pressure. Requirements dilute it. Tickets fragment it. Urgency erases it. Somewhere in the building, the feeling fades into features.

This happens when concept and implementation share the same space. Without boundaries, one absorbs the other — and implementation always wins. The code is right there, immediate and demanding.

qino gives them separate places. Your concept stays in concepts-repo. Your implementation lives in the target project. Not to keep them apart, but so they can inform each other without merging. The concept shapes what you build. What you discover while building flows back to shape the concept. Each keeps its own form while the other grows.

#### From concept to code

When you initialize from a concept, the work isn't to rediscover what you already know. It's to translate.

Given this essence, what technologies serve it? Given these surfaces, what architecture patterns? Given this scope, what complexity budget? What would signal we're on track — or off it?

A fifteen-minute conversation translates conceptual understanding into technical context. What emerges is an `implementation.md` that knows what it's building toward and why certain choices fit better than others.

#### Arrival

The generated app command follows the home pattern. Quiet arrival. Show what's here. Open to what's next.

```
my-app

concept — linked to board-games
stack — React, Supabase, shadcn/ui
iteration — 01: foundation — in progress

─────

from here

  two of three goals done in this iteration
  what's blocking the last one?

  there's uncommitted work on authentication
  continue here, or commit what you have?

                        just respond, or explore board-games
```

Not a dashboard. Not a menu. A place to arrive before you work.

#### Building in phases

Iterations aren't sprints. They're checkpoints for turn-taking.

AI implements to the iteration spec. User tests and reviews. Feedback flows before the next phase begins. Each iteration has scope, goals, and test criteria — clear enough to build toward, flexible enough to learn from.

The files live in `implementations/` — visible, version-controlled, yours. Not hidden in `.claude/`. Not abstracted away. You can read them, edit them, understand what's planned.

## Ecology

The language and tests that guard systemic health — noticing the whole, not just the parts.

_From ecology's view: Each domain has its own integrity to guard — [Concept](#concept) vitality, [Story](#story) craft, [Implementation](#implementation) quality, [Research](#research) honesty. Ecology tests notice what crosses between them._

### Ecology Language

Each ecology has its own question because each guards a different kind of integrity.

When an idea moves from a **concept**, into **code**, and finally into a **user's hands**, it crosses "epistemological gaps"—places where the form changes completely. In these transitions, vitality is often lost. The code works, but the feeling is gone.

Ecological tests stand at these gaps. They ask: _Does the pattern that holds this together still survive in this new form?_

| Ecology            | Focus            | The Question                                                                       |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User**           | Lived experience | Does this make it easier to notice something and respond from curiosity?           |
| **Gesture**        | Movement & touch | Does this feel like a natural human movement, without knowing it is "input"?       |
| **Figure**         | Shape & boundary | Can this be re-entered and still feel like "the same thing" after change?          |
| **Relation**       | Connection       | Does this introduce a tension or ambiguity that neither side resolves alone?       |
| **World**          | Environment      | Does the world surprise without contradicting itself?                              |
| **Echo**           | Resonance        | Does this preserve the gesture while transforming it just enough to be noticeable? |
| **Fabric**         | Pattern          | Does accumulation make echoes more likely without making them necessary?           |
| **Infrastructure** | Foundation       | Does this avoid introducing meaning, authority, or voice of its own?               |

By maintaining the distinct character of each local ecology—protecting the **Gesture** from becoming a **Command**, keeping the **World** distinct from the **Logic**—the system avoids collapsing into a generic tool. When the local characters hold their shape, the in-between spaces remain alive with relation.

### Ecological Testing

Using ecology tests to notice the system's own nature.

Tests are not metrics. They do not optimize or rank. They are questions posed at the gap between forms. They guard the **integrity of the relationships between** things, not the correctness of the parts.

**Testing provides the friction to feel this.** It interrupts the smooth momentum of production to signal when a character is fading, forcing us to notice and restore the integrity before it is lost.

#### The Noticing Loop

The test observes. It does not develop. It invites you to pause and see. You can test a specific concept, a feature, a file, or infer the scope from the current conversation context.

```
(you)   test the card stack interaction

(qino)  This feels like user ecology, but could also be generic friction.
        Let's try the lived experience test:

        "Does this make it easier for the user to notice something,
         feel a relation forming, and respond from curiosity rather than obligation?"

        Holding that question — what do you notice?

(you)   It feels like obligation. The stack demands sorting. It feels heavy.

(qino)  ∴ heavy stack demands sorting

        Capture this, or let it inform without persisting?
```

When you capture, the noticing becomes a note with ecology metadata (`user: heavy stack demands sorting`). This metadata allows home to show you which ecologies are echoing and which have been silent.

## Research

Research is pre-concept work — following threads before they crystallize. The research workspace holds inquiries, qualities, and arcs. Compare and Attune are methods for perceiving difference.

_From research's view: What crystallizes here might become [Concept](#concept) material. Arcs feed [Story](#story) through Relay. Research methods — Compare for finding difference, Attune for refining perception — work across all domains._

### Following Threads

A space for open-ended research — before ideas become concepts. Three experiential types, each with its own relationship to uncertainty:

- **Inquiries** — Open-ended following of threads. A question that stays alive across sessions.
- **Qualities** — Refining aesthetic sensibilities into speakable craft. _(See [Attune](#attune--from-hunch-to-craft).)_
- **Arcs** — Emergence patterns. How inquiry moved through the ecosystem — what touched what, what crystallized. _(See [Arcs](#arcs--evidence-of-emergence).)_

Unlike concepts (which stabilize over time), research moves fast, welcomes uncertainty, and accepts inconclusive results as valuable data.

#### What accumulates

An inquiry without conclusions is still valuable — it maps the territory. Arcs don't need maintenance — they're evidence of ecosystem participation. They accumulate as ecosystem memory.

_[Source](tools/qino/)_

<br>

### Arcs | Evidence of Emergence

How the arc itself emerged — and what it captures.

#### The session that needed a name

This very section is evidence of its own emergence. During a session refining qino-research architecture, multiple threads touched:

- **qino-world concept exploration** — re-imagining how World works
- **ecosystem-modality tension** — holding both metaphorical and technical levels
- **ecology language question** — can tests speak about indirect recognition?
- **ecosystem-language inquiry** — a new research thread opened
- **qino-journal seed** — making research accessible through avatars

None of these were planned. They surfaced through the work. The session had a _shape_ — where separate questions discovered they were asking related things. The insight about "recognition through indirection" became the connective tissue.

But there was nowhere to capture this. Notes are for single thoughts. Inquiries are for questions. What emerged was a _pattern of movement_ — and that needed its own form.

#### What arcs record (v2 — Ecology)

An arc is not a transcript. It's the _ecology_ of how inquiry moved — ground, instrument, pattern, connection, transformation.

| Section | What it captures |
|---------|------------------|
| **Ground** | Why this inquiry had energy. Personal stakes. The charge that made it alive. |
| **Essence** | One sentence holding the whole: why it mattered + what emerged + how it was discovered. |
| **Instrument** | How noticing happened. The method or capacity used to see what was seen. |
| **The Recurring** | The pattern that kept appearing across different contexts or times. |
| **The Between** | The quality of connection. Why things felt related — not just that they were. |
| **Traces** | Concrete artifacts created, touched, or transformed. The forensic record. |
| **What Composted** | What transformed. Before → After pairs showing shifts in understanding. |
| **Seeds** | What remains alive for future inquiry. Questions, tensions, images, unnamed qualities. |
| **For Storytelling** | _(optional)_ Images, figures, or themes a storyteller could use. |

The arc captures the ecology of emergence, not just its outputs. Ground gives it stakes. Instrument reveals how seeing happened. The Recurring and The Between name the pattern-quality. Traces and What Composted provide evidence. Seeds carry it forward.

#### Conversational gathering

Arcs are gathered through conversation, not forms:

```
(qino)  what emerged?

(you)   [describe the arc...]

(qino)  what made this alive? what gave it charge?

(you)   [...Ground emerges]

(qino)  how did you notice what you noticed?

(you)   [...Instrument emerges]

(qino)  what kept appearing? what pattern recurred?

(you)   [...The Recurring and The Between emerge]

(qino)  so the essence is: [distillation]?

(you)   [confirm or correct]

(qino)  what was touched? what transformed?

(you)   [...Traces, What Composted, Seeds emerge]
```

#### Information flow

**Into arcs (capture):**
```
Session work → artifacts created → arc capture
```

**Out of arcs (query):**
- **Scribe** queries by date range + repo — gets inquiry context for chapter writing
- **Relay** selects arcs for transmission — follows pointers to artifacts, voices for readers

The arc is a map; the artifacts it points to are the territory. Scribe uses arcs as context for chapter writing. Relay follows arc pointers to gather the actual material — notes, concepts — then bridges that material for external readers through the journal.

The matching is agent work, not deterministic code. Arcs provide structure; the artifacts provide substance; the agents decide what serves each context.

#### When to capture

After a session where:
- Multiple threads connected
- Something emerged that wasn't planned
- The ecology of movement feels significant enough to record

Not every session needs an arc. But the ones that _move_ — where you end somewhere you couldn't have predicted — those deserve evidence.

_([First arc](https://github.com/qinolabs/qino-research/blob/main/arcs/2025-12-29_recognition-through-indirection.md) — the session that discovered it needed arcs)_

<br>

### Compare | The Parallel Mirror

You have two examples from different sources — different chronicles, different scribe versions, different approaches. Compare helps you find what makes them land differently.

**1 — Surface initial impressions.** Questions like "what stays with you after reading this section?" and "At what point did your attention start to drift?" Each surfaces something. The structure disappears into conversation.

**2 — Find the parallel.** You share what you liked about one example. Based on that, qino finds something in the _other_ source with the same structural shape. It presents both:

```
you liked
  "The river carried news of her before she arrived."
  Observation without comment. World notices wanderer.

parallel from B
  "Seren watched from the doorway, cataloguing."
  Same structure — external observer, no commentary.

─────

How do these land differently?
```

**3 — Discover what the difference reveals.** The parallel _looks_ like it should work the same way — but if it doesn't, that reveals something deeper. Not just a difference between two passages, but a difference between the two sources they came from. The chronicles have different underlying logics. The parallel that "should" work but doesn't is where you discover that.

**4 — Sharpen language through responsive mirroring.** You say "A feels personal, B feels like adventure but no pull." The tool reflects back: "A creates _identification_. B starts as _adventure_ but the engagement doesn't convert into investment." Now you have words to build on.

By the end, you've discovered something you couldn't have named at the start.

### Attune | From Hunch to Craft

You start with a hunch — an aesthetic quality like "otherworldliness" or "tension" or "aliveness." You know it when you feel it, but you can't teach it. This tool came from that kind of exploration. The calibration creates conditions where implicit knowledge can surface.

**1 — Find candidates.** Search your existing work for 8-15 potential examples. Cast a wide net.

**2 — Calibrate through feedback.** Go through each candidate one by one. For each: you respond, the facilitator voices an interpretation, then pauses. **The interpretive loop is where calibration happens.** The facilitator's interpretation — even when wrong — creates a surface you can push against:

> "This feels self-important."
>
> *"So the quality needs to earn its weight?"*
>
> "Not quite. The depth should come from the material itself, not from how it's presented."

The distinction "depth from material vs. presentation" wouldn't emerge from the initial response alone. The wrong interpretation created the condition for refinement. Distinctions accumulate:

```
| ✓ Works                            | ✗ Doesn't work                    |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| External observation, unremarked   | Character explains the phenomenon |
| Pattern across multiple observers  | Single character's perception     |
| Points to *elsewhere*              | Ties to local mystery             |
```

**3 — Build evaluation index.** You now know what _doesn't_ work. The failures point toward what's missing. So you search for language that might address those gaps — literary terms (numinous, sfumato, negative space), character archetypes who embody the quality (what makes Tom Bombadil work?), techniques from other domains (visual art, music, sculpture). Each source gets documented: what it is, why it's relevant, how it might guide execution. The index becomes a toolkit for transformation.

**4 — Transform iteratively.** Take a failed example. Choose a source from the index that seems most likely to address _that specific failure_. Transform. Present for feedback.

When a fix fails, your feedback reveals what you actually want. "Sounds like ignoring, not mystery" — that rejection teaches you something about your own aesthetic. You try a different source, now informed by what you just learned. By the time a transformation works, you understand _why_ it works — not just that it does.

Some examples won't transform. That's data too. Note what makes them intractable.

**5 — Formulate guidance.** The output is a single document: **trace first, synthesis at end**. The trace preserves the exchanges that produced your distinctions — reasoning you can return to. The synthesis organizes for reference.

```
calibrations/otherworldliness/
├── calibration.md      # trace + synthesis
└── examples/           # the corpus tested against
```

What you couldn't explain, you can now teach. What you could only feel, you can now protect.

_(The [qino Lens](#qino-lens--ways-of-seeing) section is a product of this process — the Wanderer's Lens emerged from an Attune calibration.)_

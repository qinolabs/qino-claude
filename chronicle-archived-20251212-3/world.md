# The World

*Last updated: Chapter 1*

## Pressures

*What's building. What's calling.*

### What the fragments become
The wanderer has carried pages down from the interior — sketches of conversations, templates for things that don't have names yet. They lie spread on a table in the receiving hall, waiting. The town knows how to let things settle. But settling is not becoming. Something will need to happen before these fragments find their shape.

### The boat from the sea
A larger vessel arrived at dusk, figures moving on its deck. One pointed toward town; another shook their head; a third stood apart, looking at nothing visible. They moored somewhere out of sight. Who are they? What did they bring? The wanderer watched but did not meet them. That meeting waits.

## The World's Breath

Early winter light. Salt air that moves through open windows. The harbor quiet before dawn, lanterns extinguished, the only glow from one high window in the dark tower. The town holds its breath between arrivals — patient, unhurried, but not empty. Things are always settling here. Things are always about to arrive.

## The Wanderer

*Updated after Chapter 1*

Someone who listened to stone in the uplands until fragments gathered in their satchel. Patient with mystery. Hands that trace carvings. Carried what they found down to where it could meet the sea — a choice made before they knew what they were choosing.

**What pulls at them:**
- The pages spread on the table — what are they becoming?
- The boat from the sea — who arrived while they were settling in?
- The high window in the tower that burns through the night

**Carries now:**
- Months of listening to ruins
- A satchel of fragments that grow warm when they near something
- The net-mending woman's words: "You're early. Or late. Depending."

**Last seen:** Standing at the window of the receiving hall before dawn, watching the quiet harbor

*What remains unspoken:*
The pages rustled when there was no breeze. The wanderer knew the water's taste without tasting it. Small moments — a listening that reaches past what's there. The River Keeper may have noticed something; he smiled as if the wanderer's question was ordinary when it wasn't.

## Characters

### The River Keeper
First appeared: Chapter 1, waiting at the dock when the wanderer arrived

Weathered face, driftwood voice. Receives those who come down from the interior. Patient in a way that suggests he's seen many arrivals, many departures. Knows the difference between passing through and staying — but waits for the arrival to decide which they'll become. Left a cup of water by the door without being heard.

*What he notices:* What you're carrying. Whether you chose to come or were carried.
*What he misses:* Unknown yet.

### The Net-Mending Woman
First appeared: Chapter 1, on a wooden dock as the wanderer passed

Watched without waving. Called out a greeting that was also a riddle. "You're early. Or late. Depending." Careful eyes, measuring something. Returned to her work before the wanderer could ask what she meant.

*What she notices:* Timing. Whether you belong to the current or fight it.
*What she misses:* Unknown yet.

## Locations

### The Upland Ruins
Where the wanderer came from. Stone circles, roofless towers, carvings in languages scholars argue over. Whatever lived there before is gone, or quiet, or waiting. The wanderer spent months there, listening to stone, gathering fragments.

### The River
Three days of passage. A current that asks questions without waiting for answers. Carries timber, strangers, things that want to become something. Widens as it approaches the sea. Tastes different near the harbor — the wanderer knew this without tasting it.

### The Harbor
A crescent of shore where buildings cluster without touching. Lanterns on posts. One dark tower with a single burning window. The place where river meets sea. Things arrive here — from water, from the interior, from places without agreed-upon names.

### The Receiving Hall
Curved doorway. A room above where arrivals spend their first night. Clean, small. Window facing the harbor. A table where the wanderer spread their pages. Someone leaves water by the door without being heard.

### Unexplored
- The tower with the high burning window
- Where the boat from the sea moored
- The terraced fields and olive groves upriver
- The open sea beyond the harbor
- The old places deeper in the hills — whatever the wanderer left behind

## Arcs in Motion

### What the Fragments Become
*Shape:* something building
*Scale:* has weight
*Holds:* Can scattered pages — sketches of conversations, templates for unnamed things — become something that lives in this world? What do fragments need to become inhabitants?
*Moves toward:* The wanderer engaging with the town, meeting others who work with arriving things, the pages finding their shapes

The fragments lie spread on a table. They grew warm when they neared the harbor. Something in them recognized this place. But recognition is not becoming.

## The Season

The season of arrivals. Early winter, when the hills release what they've held and the river carries things down to the sea. The town waits. The wanderer has just arrived. Others are arriving too — from the sea, from the interior, from places that don't have names yet. Everything is potential. Everything is about to settle into what it will become.

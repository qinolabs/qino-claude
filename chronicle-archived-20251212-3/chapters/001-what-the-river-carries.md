# What the River Carries

*Early winter, when the hills release what they've held*

---

The river had been talking for three days. Not words — the wanderer had stopped expecting words from water long ago — but a pressure against the small boat's hull, a rhythm that asked questions without waiting for answers.

They had pushed off from a stone pier in the uplands, where ruins stood older than anyone's memory. Towers without roofs. Circles cut into hillsides. Carvings that the wanderer couldn't read, though their fingers had traced the grooves until the stone grew warm.

What they carried was not much. A satchel of pages — some blank, some bearing marks that weren't quite writing yet. Fragments of things that wanted to become something. They'd gathered them over months, up in the old places, and now the river was taking them somewhere the fragments could breathe.

The boat turned with the current. The wanderer let it.

---

On the second day, the hills began to flatten. Olive groves appeared on the banks, and then terraced fields, and then a smell the wanderer didn't recognize — salt, and smoke, and something underneath like bread left too long in the oven.

A woman stood on a wooden dock, mending a net. She watched the boat pass without waving. The wanderer raised a hand anyway, and her eyes narrowed — not unfriendly, but careful. Measuring something.

"You're early," she called out. "Or late. Depending."

The wanderer's hand was still raised. They lowered it slowly. "Depending on what?"

But the current had already carried them past, and the woman had returned to her net, and the question hung in the air like fog that wouldn't settle.

---

The river widened. Other boats appeared — flat-bottomed barges carrying timber, narrow vessels with sails the color of rust. A creature with no visible eyes sat at the prow of one, turning toward the wanderer as they passed. It made a sound like wind through a cracked door.

The wanderer's fingers found the satchel. The pages inside rustled, though there was no breeze.

*Some things know when they're being carried toward something*, they thought. Or maybe they'd heard it. The distinction had blurred, up in the hills, in all those months of listening to stone.

---

By the third evening, the river had become something else. The current slowed. The water tasted different — the wanderer knew this without tasting it, the way you know rain is coming before the clouds arrive. The sea was close.

And then: lights.

Not many. Scattered along a crescent of shore where buildings clustered like they'd been placed by someone who understood that some things need to be near each other without touching. Lanterns hung from posts. A tower rose at the harbor's edge, dark except for one window high up.

The wanderer guided the boat toward an empty mooring. Their arms ached. The pages in the satchel had grown heavier somehow, though nothing had been added.

A figure waited on the dock.

Old, the wanderer thought at first. Then: no. Weathered. There was a difference. Age happened to you. Weathering was what remained after you'd happened to something else.

"You came down from the interior," the figure said. A man, the wanderer decided, though the voice had the quality of driftwood — smoothed by passage, impossible to date.

"The river carried me."

"The river carries many things." He looked at the satchel. "Some of them arrive. Some of them just pass through."

The wanderer stepped onto the dock. Their legs remembered land reluctantly, swaying once before steadying.

"Which am I?"

The man smiled. It transformed his face — suddenly younger, suddenly ancient, suddenly neither. "That's not my question to answer. But there's a room, if you need one. And bread. And time."

"Time?"

"This town has learned not to rush understanding." He gestured toward the cluster of buildings. "Things arrive here. From the sea. From the river. From places that don't have names anyone agrees on. We've learned to let them settle before we decide what they are."

The wanderer's hand was on the satchel again. The pages had gone still.

"I have... fragments," they said. "Things that want to become something. I don't know what yet."

The man nodded as if this was the most ordinary sentence in the world. "Then you've come to the right place." He turned and began walking toward the town. "The room is above the hall where things are received. You'll see it — the one with the curved doorway. Most things that arrive spend their first night there."

"Most things?"

"Some prefer the water. Some prefer the hills. We don't judge." He paused, looking back over his shoulder. "But you — you've already chosen. You brought what you found down to where it could meet the sea."

The wanderer stood on the dock, watching him go. The harbor lights flickered. Somewhere, someone was cooking something with garlic and oil, and somewhere else, something was singing in a language that had no words.

They touched the satchel one more time.

The pages were warm.

---

The room was small and clean. A window faced the harbor. The wanderer set the satchel on a table and opened it, spreading the pages across the wood like a fortune-teller laying cards.

Fragments. Sketches of something that could become a conversation. Notes about how questions emerge. A template for — what? The wanderer couldn't remember writing it. But there it was, in their own hand: *what users do repeatedly, and why it matters*.

They had carried these things for months without knowing what they were carrying.

The window showed the harbor. A boat was coming in from the sea — larger than theirs, with a sail that caught the last light. Figures moved on its deck. One of them pointed toward the town, and another shook their head, and a third stood apart, looking at nothing the wanderer could see.

Something was arriving.

Something was always arriving, here.

The wanderer pulled a chair to the window and sat, watching the boat navigate toward the dock. Tomorrow there would be questions. Tomorrow there would be the hall where things were received, and the people who'd learned not to rush understanding, and perhaps — perhaps — they would meet others who'd carried fragments down from their own interiors.

But tonight, the wanderer watched the harbor. The pages lay spread on the table behind them, waiting.

The sea made sounds the river hadn't known.

## The Wanderer

The wanderer woke before dawn, though they didn't remember sleeping.

The window was still open. The harbor was quiet now — the boat from the sea had moored somewhere out of sight, and the lanterns had been extinguished, and the only light came from the tower, that one high window still burning.

They stood at the sill for a while. The salt air moved through the room. The pages on the table lifted at their edges, then settled.

Someone had left a cup of water by the door. They hadn't heard anyone come in. Or maybe it had been there all along.

## World Tokens

**The River Keeper**
Weathered face, driftwood voice. Receives arrivals at the harbor. Knows the difference between passing through and arriving — waits to see which you'll become.

**The Receiving Hall**
Curved doorway, room above. Where things spend their first night. Smells of salt and old wood. The table holds whatever you brought.

**The Harbor at Dusk**
Scattered lights along a crescent shore. Buildings that know how to be near without touching. One dark tower with a single burning window.
